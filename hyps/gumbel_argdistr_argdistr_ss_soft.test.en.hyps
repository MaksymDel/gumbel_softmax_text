there is an lincoln marketing for for local organization to give me act of when they make about point , a matter because the way we can didn &apos;t buy any .

the answer is : there , let &apos;s going to to the morning , , to you really to change to making . 
something little bit like like our dinosaurs is now a number of choice , which being going to be kind of . 
we don &apos;t generate identity ; we invent it . 
there we accept something often like to say . 
that means says every day , once you morning your morning , they decide to decide what you can want the for a of a person . to going it . 
to play and and , i gave gave back few time in the room that characteristics that anybody has given cut things as fast , as she could starting and every day , how did children like how many did they could get . 
the only effect went was , because cannot &apos;t say , and not . they didn &apos;t . 
so we &apos;re all . time . 
i follow teach me made young computer students , and i &apos;m offered to five percent less than i first work . 
and it &apos;s not because they are less smart , and you &apos;re nearly very done . 
it , because they were working with things things they ask yourself , &quot; &apos;m wrong investment ? i i customers now ? 
should i say more lunch ? should ever know firms , or have a career ? 
these are all shatter questions questions 
and they ask -- those biggest phenomenon after this , this from all but these projects make doing to get and audiences good jarreth watch my course . 
and in &apos;s , they do it is we &apos;re going questions , economists , 
work -- we have been chair , adam , has has run us allows all allow us to assume base of every second of this year on the planet . the on to fan . . 
and by way to the corner -- i &apos;m not going to tell talk what is palm . work . @@UNKNOWN@@ want 
i &apos;m not &apos;ll tell you you because how i it solution . 
so what it means that this powerful freedom of malnutrition don have if on ethic potential after doing skills , again , and again , 
we can look our children for functions play and , and we have our mobile phone to a against , arm and our our hatching , our our friends our our brother and followed drug our our own . our mirror .

should i board get this sent me ? i write it ? &quot; 
and even if the answer to &quot; question , &quot; no , is &quot; it will certainly taking their experience of their of the children when closed children , &apos;t much fully it &apos;s been it . 
all everywhere , , things , and things things things that things and lifestyle , lives is a question of choice .

so , want i want to a primary branches -- but but not wasn &apos;t a a question of choice .

no one in the world of the america , this &apos;s realize , if they invested it , you you couldn not all what it comes like things . 
the truth is more things that . 
the reason the that used to everything better when it was worse was to of everything , it was for the world to experience experience smart of one that might that idea . 
now , in the world we live in -- we them , lehman citizen , with as an utilitarian -- that i hope best that , be places as that are shouldn should you are and are understanding of it . 
we &apos;s never a kobe director because they &apos;re the passion , my expectations , are are 
the secret to the test -- that &apos;s kind of all -- it &apos;s having secret follow the giant low expectations . 
now &apos;s i &apos;m say , a quick i am just a little bit where i have married be married and she &apos;s really beautifully wonderful wonderful . 
i couldn &apos;t have better i any better -- i didn &apos;t have point . 
but charles leads is another bad thing . 
, hundreds of multiple ways of starting garbage , and you buy bought them ate , and and you come why is be the ? 
and it it &apos;s the the that the to to you ? 
they would have to do it . 
with 100 different sorts of here at genitalium , there &apos;s no a privilege mistakes it . 
and as if human feel , i and choices or the even taking &apos;re doing is quite , how what feel they &apos;re concerned about yourself , . they you receive resistant . themselves you . 
prior for locomotion in the major world in last 30 generation . 
so this is that airline that it becomes is human is , objective , and we feel ourselves . 
you let me remember you . 
this is the marriage state , which we this have it all this is wrong it . it &apos;s not true 
there is &apos;t a question bit something like better better , but it &apos;s not controlled that someone than choice choice better than choice 
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s . 
i &apos;m sure sure we recent things over the chance because we have good improve for greater our . . 
now , an hasn an coach . i &apos;m done done quick intuition than the point about the science that &apos;s what what these these tools this allows to to the agricultural societies , material diseases unsustainable . 
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard on many of think -- and &apos;ve not pick to the big law for you 
they problem is they to . 
so the things i speak talk is a crazy , the modern , rich , , western societies have countries . 
and therefore is so frustrating and evil folks about talking about it &apos;s about how about these searching these technological and hard to wonder in the car seats that work is it waste of money . 
what i tell tell you that expensive expensive , these &apos;s complicated the ; not &apos;s folks can don &apos;t help to 
they even fell . 
so worried about all on . 
if people people that the reward , people to to for this as journey to living samples extraordinary heads ; not only technology keep change living not , their lives be our . lives . 
economists call this well infrared divide . 
imaging sins is it the better &apos;s it one of the poor enough because -- all of these great choices multiple types of channels . 
and finally , you you a read , line , an economist person , says , &quot; oh ! what &apos;s it fish ? 
you know what you can &apos;t get that ? 
holiday base , an favorite view i the world -- and that &apos;s the best way i read , i 
all the i i &apos;ve thought about that , more , i began to that was which seine fish fish something 
because the truth is that when if go last horror of it &apos;s okay possible that they have jupiter . protects &apos;s paralysis . 
if it &apos;re breaking the flute set area that everything that possible possible increase and happiness . 
now may organized , blocking transplant goes . 
everybody takes a quantum . . 
this updated almost practicality of state should be you and they for gender , definitely responsible for us . 
but the re-create diet takes a a a strong prize for of driver , and i think , somewhere . 
thank you very much . 
you know , i had talked about another findings in these three of , , the human genome and what that mean natural and talking about describes the new of groups groups . growth . 
in fact , we are starting to another video coming us we &apos;ve come the philosophy and now , we &apos;re talking about use digital digital to biology on to start to creating new new life . 
we tend always been important questions . 
what is life ? it &apos;s something i realized that scientists biologists are of you organisms , and other they do on neat 
we have to different approaches to uncomfortable it into contrast to the components components 
we &apos;ve mad afghanistan as cholera since we &apos;ve renny the benefits -- the by of the present play in the world &apos;s the world . 
now we try to think we can actually synthesize lives or or we might create new life from the digital universe ? 
this is the map of the little organism , greater processing , which the the genome has done a way a the longer the in the fly around patients and and we had to come it shall , if we could bring him walking up smaller with a small grid 
we did slowly more about on hundred million genes in oxygen around that ones that of is . . 
so we decided that &apos;s to it the only way to actually this chromosome actually is able to compare its parts of components of diverse form questions questions . questions . 
and so we people to a question about could we carolyn a receive spacecraft ? 
so it could allow that really big major molecule on something never been done before ? 
and if we can the , , we can able to jumped the wires ? 
a clearly is the by the way , , a break of material is organic material . 
our steps of the farm was exponential is exponentially . 
our ability of collection that digital really approaches very grow also down , but now , , at our final place view except . 
we started doing 15 years ago 
the did that was did some attempt for an before project before were learned on the 
it turns turns out there is a very difficult . 
there are many of set spread around world are put those little bit the dna , and 30 30 years , but &apos;s is a pace , and so , you let to be a piece of rub , more stuff happen . 
so we were to to develop a new method that we could get those little translate emotions and away wild autistic 
so our that we did , we studying , now with playing digital information , the genome the of the load x x . 
it &apos;s a a colony female occurring bacteria . 
we &apos;re actually little bits billion , @@UNKNOWN@@ a battery aspect of a a dna molecule a proportions are that 5,000 trillion . 
and the story of next we &apos;d been contributing and of protein we turn it into a bacterium , and bacteria , comes the the the code of signals and the cutting array the genetic protein . 
and then spectacular particles were killed and then get and come come then become expect knights . 
at i i , the focus of the oil , they they said their this , will . picture . 
they laughed shouting out of you . . . 
so , here that fact gives the situation is actually even its own hardware is can create create a biological system . 
design is key key , and if you how to encourage you maybe information get information &apos;s digital computer , have global real information crazy . every been 
when we actually would recorded the beginning of in 1995 , the outcome on a errors consumes 10,000 dollars , 
we found aside in the failure 30 10-year-old when if , was ever add the original organized several would never would have been able to see out in 
a part the design is me it awake by read hundreds solution largest , and whatsoever practice are without all make up @@UNKNOWN@@ to split smaller look office . 
we we have unique elements here into . 
they may maybe have &apos;ve &apos;ve received the camera . 
think about that to : we : have a a idea machine : &quot; , c , c and making . odd 
and disorders of the letters -- this letters good-bye over been bombs are egg . there , and a single quality for every of these perfect particles . 
so we can use of genetic code to writing our words , sentences , thoughts . 
in first we just earlier . 
some people people people liked it wasn was my poetry 
we have the liberals paintings so we have able to organize them bacteria should &apos;s messy or it work but and now again it together . 
and we &apos;re starting back to make paintings again , , ended up to secrets and shoulder americans put were in come @@UNKNOWN@@ and into these together to to help order to into this back , goals . 
in all one we have taken these pieces of evil which we were going out , and because were tried to open-minded a tools completely acts , saw be shown in a minute . 
we &apos;re going to get the key to the live category series 
so this looks like a train game . 
and we enter to the right together . -- as jonathan passes , and 50 feet &apos;ll not bring repeat output rule costa vitamin regards clever , is the agricultural the future applied solar program , and so we &apos;ve the talked of allowed path . &quot; 
we knew the is from a mechanism that the foreign the poem that technology zoom in biology and everything these parts buttons together . 
here &apos;s an example of the . there is a sphere called yes @@UNKNOWN@@ gene produces appliances of radiation . 
you see at the upper spacecraft , , the bet just forever . up . 
12 to columns , @@UNKNOWN@@ , until anything sake took way how this was the . 
we have thousands of organisms that can do this . 
these organisms can get totally broken , you can even get in a vacuum . 
and &apos;m certainly cruel to space in space and and move can water at the conditions for an conditions . 
in fact , nasa did all has there there matter where is bits majority of it . 
here &apos;s a met upon from the the we used this terms from our processes -- in fact have the only ph.d. hour to to the information , we call design them , exploration solid and store together . 
it &apos;s not a clue , it is a . docks . . 
it &apos;s so large molecule big that we can detect it see . ending . it . 
this is collected by a long seconds of 18 seconds . 
that &apos;s the first-class you people of recent recently . 
this is about hannah send called @@UNKNOWN@@ talks code that &apos;s the largest molecule in with had most group that are ever actions . 
it has a spill of in 300 @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
if we computing it with a single @@UNKNOWN@@ after 10 inquiry without display spheres ; they would via explode sounds notes , hold backwards genetic names . 
now , how do we get a daf-2 ? how can we maestro it ? 
obviously , it mean was to tag number right impressive -- what &apos;s a bit more , with defend . 
it &apos;s also going than give it in skin happened as committed , this gives data get the presence out , and there &apos;s the one bias in that , and &apos;s . you &apos;ve heard @@UNKNOWN@@ . already . 
in fact record is something represent not your sand provided the cancer developed only recently that we can access to a spectrum to a single dna from one cell to have that classroom . 
the new chromosome only in the cell . 
in fact it thought was , the end , it , but we &apos;ve to to work chaos history a little thing . 
this is the receiver @@UNKNOWN@@ of in here . 
we are all kinds of species species the individual piece tagged , or extra of poem does every except for thousands per couple of which staircase . a second few jury . 
so people literally imagine imagine how darwinian exists at that point individual to development increases a more terms of biology . 
there are the materials that called the the compound cells now similar dna . 
the chromosome that there , no one so ; we put each and you got 
it was deposited in the cell , and then figured the had little rasmussen than staggering silent , that we were just just a cell with a new chromosome . 
so it was blue back about we , so we had discovered . 
and after a very time time there were votes have responsive out of 1988 library system feet retrieve up a new species on the new our technology software that were emerged , any use the site . 
all the proteins on getting mammal countries actually understood rewire the when the the the genetic code was , they did was . tags . 
it like much do much sound , but we can finish changing neural unified change things even dramatic dramatic degradation . 
now , i need that hue that this colored the is not &apos;s a on about billion billion years . evolution may 
i &apos;ve thought that we were totally that example was a new shape of the diagonal center of that reach a massive new online feature on and brad with the digital design . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it is quite obvious in the option we we are . 
we are at we have nine to nine population program the next 40 years , 
i &apos;d in the right , i i was born in pig . 
today is three two donor on this planet planet something it bigger have from places that in five , years . we &apos;re going to be four . 
we have problems with walls , clean neat air , cancer , save an variants . 
there is going to offer for is innovation a prime towards nine . 
we need talking about five efficiency of takes @@UNKNOWN@@ local billion possible of oil . this kane hundred million of a superconducting grade every day . 
when we think about just processes own or despite process , a at we , it becomes a gigantic challenge . 
then , of course , it &apos;s the wind measure of these material and water into the atmosphere . 
so , we have learned created our discoveries over the world , a database to about 20 million genes and and i want to think some these bill the main future . 
the nathaniel a changed a dozen components and so see paul time that came @@UNKNOWN@@ 
we we in them line on way cymatics of the areas of the already , for of us to it . 
we are technologies transition starting our coincidentally today , quick engineering to do this right now call progress . 
now we have have a chance that build have a @@UNKNOWN@@ robots could make the net to create pretty list . six months . 
as they imagine imagine 20 20 billion different living like those or make obstacles to to go or search with products and new resources as we do spin some don a two learning learning use more input than the last 20 years . 
and it &apos;s only selection of selection , we can move bill @@UNKNOWN@@ progress of chemicals , forces of chemicals or solar forests and 
this is a &apos;ve made of from notes . in the really molecular an letting we actually see aside and a new movement for changing your computer . 
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it out , we we are exactly the seeing of the code . look like to operate . 
so , we are further to harvesting on the fourth generation . 
they &apos;ve proved globalization units ak what to &apos;re just a bad experiment . 
we are passing from over development cephalopods and thinking that ghana will get become going to come learn forms much more tokens of you could voted 
but how we think that only effect way that based on a revolutionary impact any other change maybe mark world the inadequate mechanism message based if belief is in we are going to open our cells through that &apos;s , we way , and we &apos;s where we can going 
and we think we first the world to the to with the fourth britain that three about the . 
sunlight and co2 are a species of 
now , in our finding the world we have all kinds of ways . we &apos;re different different kinds . 
that &apos;s a organism where we &apos;ve described . in there . 
he lives in the deep deep around about 300 miles , , a with obscure technology . 
it forest carbon turning growing on saddam scanning , skeletal energy source . 
we suppose if we use diet solar dioxide , which i could be easily connected be be 100 wild-posted fuel biologically to order to work . 
within a short period period that we could in the able to figure would to a the basic fundamental things for minds . 
you know , we have done introduced monopoly for limit the whole solar system , right . , wasn &apos;t &apos;t if you supposed to happen at ted party , where , the intrinsically any become energy energy energy . . 
but the exactly actually we work we for do the very try to use for flows kinds of runner . 
they &apos;ve it this year with flu flu , we &apos;re always getting of fishing and a day for , when you add -- have that big vaccine 
i think these of power produced on help stuff vaccines particles . 
that &apos;s what like for might might might be contrary to objects , micro-level is works this bird today , synthetic tissue , kill by , or maybe highly corn . 
we &apos;re producing years of geographic , but &apos;s , that it &apos;s only that we have a chance to could species them available forever survival , out for that thank you so much . 
on on on last conference , i went to line , the get basis 
and i &apos;ll leave back to to and for how the machine moment . 
so that &apos;s as investigating and and the for all at not learned not that that the american got not happened scientific scientific experiment being obtained . using 100 miles in the . . 
its job a to who driving conditions with though less than a year of of the universe -- looking out , through , propulsion -- maybe the half sen with per second . 
it &apos;s just stunning moses . 
this is the machine weather on rocks . 
we are illustrates from these simulation logs in the construction . 
i work point working . he calls this a painted recognizing a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a significant feet 3,000 increase in remote treadmill . 
here &apos;s a universe a of a cell camera in the that you . easy scale . .

it &apos;s a image of the first lost successfully , which showing all the parts beam to start your along with a part of the baby search for nuclear push on particles to to out , return to develop a genes transplant . 
in in words , as we saw on this over books , 
i know , not know certain miss the largest colonies of carbon or or take when google page says come to the telescope site and the front page . 
it means we have some , explosion in the scientific . 
what a three week , it problem with a back what kind of market with with this microscope , put that golden ant here . 
these baton pointing sea embryonic when that machine hat at 
well the , you you admire them and see , and , , no , don &apos;t not , . so &apos;s little wires in . . &quot; 
you can carry that that when you &apos;re it very apart , tell through what to get . 
the drugs direct gas , asia &apos;s in the room between the stars , can tie up a to joint . the gallon . 
in a one of the sea , there the cube in the the , , there was a resource . . 
and brings warm up cast wire coming frank and @@UNKNOWN@@ scholarship suddenly nutritional . 
this has been the result . 
now , all &apos;s is don only when you can imagine that noble can went to 20 copies thousands and i , about has about impression . 
so , we represent 50 50 the smell of

we constitute them private , they they react . 
they of all one like again . 
by the street , back the lanka will be crying be 
we we him him position off , we will send first about the street or , or , , , walking our journey and to figure out what it &apos;s building the ones . 
so , of course , there kind of having singer or these other motor having process value science science and american picture and this systems it . it go be here . 
i think that fact that &apos;s &apos;s so difficult , the context we think , manage the separate of things like the the lhc . 
thank you . 
i is a writer . 
in then writing my my job , but that &apos;s more more than it . 
it &apos;s the most love dollars and skills . 
and i don &apos;t expect getting change this change 
but also a research was there my about my life , my my was got left to really investigation of on my work completely away . 
and the result , i i can no matter where i come up , live treated or let &apos;t if i falling , the end took ground . 
seriously -- gun win leaning 
for example , they don &apos;t really me connect me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t &apos;t you &apos;ve have replicate this going to 
don &apos;t you worry because you deal , and whole their life , and never become an book that anyone in the world really never happen ? 
okay , it really really getting to . 
people said , mengatoue didn &apos;t move afraid to be has aids ? 
have &apos;t prevent afraid that make you move from author of bottleneck ? ? 
don &apos;s expect that you &apos;ll to take a studio for your life and wouldn &apos;t produce a healthy blocks life of they preserve will live up from me or chicken went its food of replace of the 10.2 of of &apos;s darwin ? 
so of you know about it their 
and the answer -- of the answer for of these these , questions @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
yes , i afraid all of these things . 
and i &apos;d always . . 
so i &apos;ve got more lot interesting things about ever though i any @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
stars / and behold with other things things . 
but if if i read is writing about i this tell myself a my and and question am for why why ? 
is that &apos;s ? 
is it imagination model of somebody &apos;s going to be whether being been changes there 
and whatever is the with institutions declared about my tracks , that we feel , about the deal of a most abstract way which don &apos;t other jobs doing other there best in doing 
my father , the , was a , and i can &apos;t me the story into a 40 years ago now when @@UNKNOWN@@ said to when pounds was ready to his nazi . 
with your name , john this how do you for this ? 
and wasn &apos;t start , know ? 
but to be ride -- tell the by the tolerance of started to call funded the the of five sequences of . 
we may be enough of kind of reputation . but not not taken the who deceased leaders but the &apos;s proteins to all the impression , so the recognition are familiar been , jewish soup . 
all that , &apos;ve been has , patient cheese monitor throughout does tree economy just danger of the valley century -- all among three hand were their of their . . 
and even the these these of humans , not on @@UNKNOWN@@ in were unhappy their their errors their 
reading inducted , in fact surprisingly his his father cluster , one every thunderstruck my book my was @@UNKNOWN@@ . little and up . 
a myth that you can make you her life . 
and the question i want like to show here today : is that this comes to all all this is 
do you feel anything like ? because about to just from not just astronauts above dumb , -- i just have &apos;t think have this in for this anybody . 
i really to it . 
and i probably find dangerous money , and i don &apos;t want to see what that will get . 
i think it better , when we are actually to do in love creative . 
and i certainly i that it &apos;s definitely me -- in my situation -- very dangerous okay in start interested this , , which which around this robustly path -- that , the think that my that in in my i was in in my career . 
means is -- -- you see : i am pretty young . i i &apos;re only about six years old 
i may still have ten of to in me anyway that i &apos;m each right time . 
and there &apos;s be truly that everything i were going to write about in the world world &apos;s work a machine for that project working my bag would be my on my favorite book , my right ? so theological 
i mean it to compassion , we have any , all because you come &apos;ve been it -- &apos;re block her being many follow it &apos;s truly is my success . my up . 
oh , jesus , what it thought thought for a . . 
it &apos;s the the way of somebody can good someone someone when tomorrow you at your during the morning , sisters -- . i don &apos;t want to me . 
i &apos;m actually be able to do this work when i i &apos;m doing . 
so the question is : how ? 
so after after bit of my sanitation , seems to me to to to to write about to and create a kind of some @@UNKNOWN@@ of the psychological foundation . 
not think about my kind of finding out being within a panbanisha , in , and and natural needy natural @@UNKNOWN@@ in the following the stockpile be be 
is search this quest , create me the old destroyed and and old afghanistan . 
please slip me me , because the circle , come again . . 
but in the old ancient and rome &apos;t people to believe that creativity is surrounded , , right ? 
they thought that creativity was kind of a was a brain drove , valves us a a new phenomenal point of people , -- made of itself , rather reasons . 
the greeks named this witness @@UNKNOWN@@ picks health @@UNKNOWN@@ calls @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
we know known to believed that he he sent a @@UNKNOWN@@ he , those the laser away from 2003 . 
the by that was the same idea , called thing kinds of of @@UNKNOWN@@ odd mind a a of those expression @@UNKNOWN@@ graduate hug . 
this &apos;s not fun that don didn didn really have a that genius in , activity that very special individual . 
this is brilliant -- it &apos;s it , , &apos;s what up yesterday went about i talked the talking the the encouraged what your power to protect your government . 
and everyone knew that worked so it this . right ? 
the artist of god drug was about genetics in programmed ways , which as a expect , much ? 
if your works is , as if kinds of can impress at all , you all everyone that is , that you have forgotten that excellent exception done that . 
if your job is always emotional book , right , 
everybody knew , was genius penis . . 
so , work people really churches before freedom of increasing harlem . 
it &apos;s the beginning of wisdom within respect and people have gotten people thinking , from completely completely about only single sight . 
to the the first time that &apos;s a thousand like this or language hacker instead -- heard that it &apos;s insane . 
i &apos;ve got to tell you , i think it was a great mistake . 
it &apos;s what like wants to impress &apos;s prime to 
conquer , and @@UNKNOWN@@ and specifically it , have these these sex expectations gives the . . 
i think that stinks had from our artists phones has 44 years . . 
and actually when that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question . 
can we change it ? 
perhaps maybe an old understanding about the relationship between people and to the puzzle of creative away . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can &apos;t meat organic away , hardly reasons from just we going to convention sources a advanced talk . 
and there are certainly people in this audience which &apos;s actually find an greatest scientific about mental vision may be by the notion the -- of evolutionary i , their of people and sea rent at projects objects and so around . this . so based on 
well i i probably should take to talk to all you you about what journey . 
but the question i want to approach to why not not ? 
why aren &apos;t this about ? ? 
it it makes more sense sense how much other which i &apos;ve learned when it was one-to-one crazy mission of investigation in the creative process of 
in that figure &apos;s what everybody knows that &apos;s have &apos;s something to do something — in other words , &quot; very not all @@UNKNOWN@@ because an general .

and i went for , i thought i was mobile einstein &apos;s &apos;s terrific -- so i think how creative that is creative process is

so it was was curiosity curiosity and i i wanted to get to more to to credit matter way . 
now i think think like that physics think brains now really fascinating and design , biotechnology , everything she approaching get with biology , and so forth . 
very important important , that has very important important is much more and far more depends on far going .

but it &apos;s actually just way right to engaging , this kind famous possible program brain setting have this already a the . 
and then we got november categories , chemotherapy . 
this &apos;s from seed million of a figure out a which is becoming a lot like the structures where you &apos;re activated , and online online 
are are little bit collective of , and yourself a little bit &apos;re , kind you see , having anybody questions like this project 
and what the kind walks , this is is that out , a sequence are from that , i &apos;ll try closely called at the first time make . 
here here in the left , right see is &apos;ve add the , -- it &apos;s a store notion , , essentially it &apos;s a way i &apos;ve , which commercial green fulfilled global , , where everyone can can jump . 
children , old , all kinds of people walk going to go to and you them on a , and at look at the can watch what we &apos;re do affected were . that 
there &apos;s on the lower in the shore : bangladesh , one they have the supported here they &apos;re are long . 
still longer than these other two . 
they &apos;re also in with own application aspect of biological materials , and they are 1.76 , and sort of collected of bricks in this different odd do 
and i &apos;ll move there on the other picture that a ever a exchange in copenhagen in the medical journal at a upon an exhibition to 
and so &apos;s , it &apos;s , right , is most likely people , , but the only what what this is actually ingredients it &apos;s the mix of organization . technology . 
and and you might make this and and in . , along so always to think and how if it but how to you to do what to do to spend a myself in the your of this so directly right ? you 
so this precondition , communication now fact , biology now , to marketing material . of it . 
you the of course of transformation , materials you want to great tools and then that &apos;s a lab . 
well , by typically you &apos;re seeing , the in a lab , that that really sort of tons machines , something very , extremely practical , @@UNKNOWN@@ , per @@UNKNOWN@@ , so with a gas and so forth . 
and our approach was a careful waving , too first , because , degrees don &apos;t have to do that . 
now it &apos;s not really respect , each every each became has committed actually a quite a technology while most amazing &apos;ve had do important , this is is those . . 
and in say , it &apos;s with idea magnitude of it dr theater of england in england is in foreign retailer , or then a poem a a , , and it , as , @@UNKNOWN@@ , , &apos;s so &apos;s affected with the bacteria how it bacteria bacteria . 
so now that characteristic individual leaves an soup soup that we &apos;ve placed travel to a long few times once enjoyable have . 
now , i would i go home to and my dog , and to a little bit , suddenly saw me show wrote on as quickly project paper just a like , surgery , you &apos;re going off neat a run that smart gone home . 
and this is under @@UNKNOWN@@ who is have refugee an i i to , which is a case of lonely design for thinking biology . 
and yes , and you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively reminiscent , so this are dying wobble people who are doing on one at so on masses to the larger tumors , have more effective that are going to be made to the even live in form states 
and , then there was the about why @@UNKNOWN@@ , who are we , what are quite want , what what we , what what ? want want going to words ? 
and what are are in take well , , are , what is our catastrophic basis , what do we ? ? 
and , then we &apos;ve got a voracious a day . 
one , right it was so intuitive wish so everyone &apos;s so so much this its following , his his you end it , the , of gone . later . 
and so , , about my own point , it idea a here says do . 
and so we didn &apos;t have sick , but in but that &apos;s yeah , i think some &apos;ve simple law on top of people are in here away 
and we even tried that , to add in the @@UNKNOWN@@ academic world , but it &apos;s not kind of a there . 
so i think we are about in the protected in in fact that one simply step the the world . 
now , what do three light do now do of right ? 
i we a project i had done again that goldberg installations in switzerland , that we find the called us active test something a or . before . 
that you are down there . way . 
and then you have a telephone of and , and the film skin the orchestra @@UNKNOWN@@ , and then &apos;s trying to on your camera . 
and &apos;ll doesn &apos;t have , , and everything we we &apos;ve &apos;ve actually a whole lot of time . 
and this project , from from this image group of paris , and working , , &apos;s pretty cool . 
and it does that , there you do as just a scene these and have an iraq -- so , that of mit is about to families , , his his is how trait @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
he is got this this this lady between there and built in the shell mobile . 
so then , the way in the could go up , that at to chair chair that chair wearing the . 
they would tear it completely , and on the what they think was something , you you could like different lights right the room at the other area 
it was quite fairly disappointed project . 
one thing thing about the the states and that has to do in the series of work and the golden that is the messy , sucks a the word . 
and it &apos;s about khanfar beliefs or goods dyeing heat , resist equipment , into make and go capable . 
and the machines that sort of kind that incredible intelligent get that you try and repair the monster positive , should the equivalent equivalent of 5 . talents 
and letting do not at the hospital finance it but it &apos;s really an cool technology that also much a lot much 
so this &apos;s only some a kind of lots that you can do do with them 
i think somehow , 100 dollars , or something like that . 
but certainly if it &apos;s are not enough not yet , but it &apos;s no empty on a state where he will never getting . . 
so it it &apos;s in a very impressive aspen . 
i put a project that i first was a had prototype solar prototyping . 
berkeley 17-year-old , yes , a is kind of flickr speech , reach about that long , , size or human diagram this . 
you give you heels and sentimental , and then members &apos; and pringle , and then then carried went with chair and that then then then grew up and then . 
so the genome that here observed there , the it doesn &apos;t work 
but it &apos;s my way of me , took take titanic tea looks like this his attached to the , performance and ball , was which was kind of pressure low . this thing had that broken . 
and then i a done the soldier model , that &apos;s kind to get to it . 
a trained card , when you relate up with complete water , signed up to i think , it , 40 way 83 at up in this bottom , it 
and so you could can tell particles to the emotional down and then they and also go into flow . 
and the commercial device goes for five , or something something @@UNKNOWN@@ was wine fly that feet of that 50 
so that doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s really &apos;t implanted . 
so , that decision , the moment at the most that is what a ted &apos; africa that the of , and to the information that more and charge information that negative more blogging is to people . 
because , as the act , , one disorder an environmental important important technology in many people can have a little bit about that and not times . very something . 
because , you , if you read this about this , we not to same same it at perspective done all or something . 
and i think technology is always important important in is modern societies societies 
and if you better at player countries great as a their management of society , and if you are to , it aid -- it to mean to problem sharing the technology of life , is jeff . 
and we for to do it and understand understanding have to understand stuff and it anything . 
and then it we @@UNKNOWN@@ the electricity open towards game medium and science . 
so &apos;s you how you seek made position any as leatherbacks have these oil . 
and that is the pig driver of dry thing . 
these are the people who at at first mt at on website website -- internet graduate 
well , that &apos;s a a number of people on the world . 
and &apos;s , interesting is you you have plexus singapore in . 
this is because i think there are less lot vienna more vision that aromatase . 
so i know , some some really controlling not risk . 
and it &apos;s only the blood , , people to choice . 
they can partly think of this report , this is these places , this . 
and this is just this very beginning as the beginning . 
as i said , it &apos;s really recently it began . 
and they situations , swamp expand , was built submarine in in berlin , was the first first berlin project . 
and that &apos;s now a a red very good list in , it computer , by world now are nearly 
and we we hope too , somehow we do are similar and we that are for , well , that can can still more people people people can be involved . 
and i would inspire to give anybody finish up with &apos;s and once you learn . 
it &apos;s not that simple , but it can &apos;t care because you mean , you &apos;re just bizarre curiosity and bizarre energy , then you can get coming too far . 
thank you very much . 
that &apos;s it . 
yes , hello . 
how do we work people wonder ? 
it looks a really such a a very much , but also in the edge of magnitude adventure in the every with the in scene of of . 
and &apos;s about the people have people in embedded media media that you can functional this interactive media and so take and you rather to a @@UNKNOWN@@ today . 
i think think transformative interactive in electrical progress is us , cognitive cognitive , , grand depth , the in our biological minds of the very , very long very always ago all upon keeping me , reclaim retrofitting interactive . , &apos;t things . 
and this &apos;s very amazing , because you believe they that that &apos;s tiny object that is that there &apos;re give you , into your future , but actually &apos;s the way that the future were in africa , which is moving our social narrative . 
what are now @@UNKNOWN@@ make we ? 
i also clothing to four foremost pieces of i &apos;d like to be a here . 
for &apos;s cognitive , and this is the pattern that we have met to much cases we . . articles don . 
this idea of that , homo told that made see ours that species using bacon . 
that sounds actually actually about about origami . 
i i &apos;ll going to do another one out , instead of them you that they may also 
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been @@UNKNOWN@@ that in our little statements actually associated very smart , , in the , , is building also do solved a a language language . 
the the third area , explains explains how reality in terms . 
we all know the israeli connection media are definition definition definition , which is called your @@UNKNOWN@@ of peasants , and what we say , as is as politics is laugh normal products . 
the fourth ever is that that story bet a a the place for us . 
they &apos;ve it is about wire that but it the world &apos;s thing is different 
i will like to prove you that . 
how many how was the house move in the in ? 
and what &apos;s eventually to going to quickly , but but what he &apos;s going to work happens and just right on thing . 
they come in the mind through this home , in home , , and look at how much shapes are there . 
and that &apos;s exactly what they do . 
they &apos;re fully controlling the faces and way it &apos;s not . computer 
fantastic , right ? 
and there are you at this happening so here the born to fly to this reality reality reactor explore through thing sight , we can actually the that i , really all . 
and that get the meaning in understanding of reality that &apos;s the other people who used issues this , be that they all , in on &apos;t been things 
they were none books books . 
or the : no one didn &apos;t matter any 
they have &apos;t a mass . 
the only thing they had , her head . 
and they mind conclude depends . a mind . 
then that has i was was mind effectively that , this virtual , the imagination , chloroquine law only been @@UNKNOWN@@ experienced . 
and this is important as important from ourselves from us , we can accurate with forever &apos;s supposed up 
so this interesting thing is now if i should actually to little a little bit . 
yeah is that . 
the interesting thing about this is that in area day after another person was their and . 
now , consider a little piece different . on . . 
what are we revolution today ? 
and then they you for a there . have .

we &apos;ve started doing pattern ... called the opposite panel of nudges hell . 
and it &apos;s happened job the trial war , and it &apos;s something and everything is what happens is @@UNKNOWN@@ . here . 
and that &apos;s the on we have been responsibility for our memories and have its own production of our individual flies are pain on for &#93; . . 
so &apos;s on book , and the picture . 
so , we won us any idea or end chinese news for a

still we &apos;ve since , @@UNKNOWN@@ as a very &apos; very article . 
the question is , what ? now 
we had the @@UNKNOWN@@ of diagnose we we had the machine machine and we return this the called this . . 
this is , the it buys and assumes , and you &apos;re looking ok like science , , i know . 
but these tickets of of that that then share taken us given these back , takes our the again . 
there to @@UNKNOWN@@ , it &apos;s about oregon descendants it &apos;s about sneezing . 
i want a explain a little time here . 
there &apos;s some certain concepts like the the installations reality , which is the reality . . 
so , i don crazy to , in the pile of my chemokines , we are don us in our chemistry , virtual worlds , too , : the model of the great legs . 
and other other are are @@UNKNOWN@@ realities -- intelligent systems . 
these are spaces spaces these are building particular become a police . people . 
all of these ability ability and our of , , our hearing is supporting our . 
i graduated i finally then i i hope the video very work , very a going to beautiful , company goes , the &apos;s museum multilayered michael cooper , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , bayonet monitor and @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and these two one are also totally today . . . 
now can be put here for strange contract . you think of is then on , and , keep the over the two over . project . 
and i have this project project recently , , as a process for cognitive perspective , cognitive models networks . 
and you of a game , i i have to hear . 
what the nelson industry is very is , and play &apos;s a computer the game medium it 
and if i argue type computer solution , some they even say full experience , any people people longer of sitting front of some pair , &apos;re just using the code with the kind of the head . 
it &apos;s so on do that in 
this &apos;s a game for out . 
and they act for thought that that i went around the outside face , so , show the three-dimensional structure . 
and this game , the one so , the , , the the patients that we make invent infidels real , in . 
i i i point so thank you policy so much would connection . 
you can actually see but much more as than little , bit material about that . 
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m outside a a place , places became a what , or it whether like 
and doing is the curve of the city through and different form , then a very different moment , i we , aggressive feelings and @@UNKNOWN@@ vulnerable urban of cars , and that all through , almost a map , this map a a new place . 
we can like do that at here . 
sam , who you can see , i &apos;s even more of , what you looks at . . 
so , code through the the world of our cities , including . . 
and with some kind kind beautiful diameter we can can see to be worlds . 
thank you . 
yeah , i &apos;m incredible challenge to me to be engaged . 
i went out that for a year regret is there a graphics of flow and my supposed to be talk . 
it &apos;s not going to do that . 
i i will be liking during what it . this is doing . 
but i have really just about out of of course . harder . 
terrorists , kids are by about feeling curious , , and make become a very , method for also 
i &apos;m a series of setting , so , i many of home belief , and how does don curiosity so and then how that play ourselves and why why we we need and enjoy and then we need and of and , now , so forth . 
this is a mid-ocean series of things so you discuss focused to , circumstances of the life . 
and when , , of are and i , you &apos;ll get up like counter , just dung . 
and this is what i did the last half colony two so . 
a the a &apos;s natural as an solved design system . . 
now you &apos;re going to , why boost whole form of it , so this so natural natural whale , communication , that the whole and so on in . . 
and because i will only taken of those small little parking lot , to hurt the , as bit , , dark thinking , as to get to see are what , it be properly . stimulation , 
so i moved myself with me , &quot; , course , or this . 
but again , again actually might take to bit a of it back . 
why is this happen going ? 
so , if only look at this new of development that recently before instance , then , &apos;re now patented from the third of the fourth 
so from of modern the in in 
all society is controlled by a unbroken model . 
at the beginning of the game @@UNKNOWN@@ through the language . 
that means you &apos;ve found is have a common language to have to communicate in the live planets to into colorado on the other , another . of this and put spring , and and that we have made form of 
so hadn was , the path &apos;s quite possible with something very was kind of living . 
and that also , don you , to you know so good to culture , not , and fact , off . of course answer alzheimer &apos;s 
that then encoded raised past state communities and space the is the epidemic . 
and that was also an internal because warning compositions , you when i think community at telling of in in by properties , which is what computer and life , what i is stand , and their greenland to i it and then i then i do to it on 
so from how i came in vegas and when , goes , i think concluded , there is a different other such of as , it stands so kind was a kind of . 
but then they movement , our separations block , mill , were course , guide . 
then the next next generation we now actually now certainly alive people 
this is a diver of pressure toilets recording rocket visualizing one &apos;s and right . 
so was just it hits the consultation capture then shopkeepers and the trader , was , had i are tiny socialism , in idiosyncratic , , they &apos;ll start to walk about happens when average lead and spare ? 
and of course , the we of us , because we see another this climate lot media , social media as facebook and happening on and so on . 
and these two worlds distance bubbles open supports , and new broker . 
and what is exciting thing to see , open-source this is a these project , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we many , very similar simple as principles , principles and @@UNKNOWN@@ phenomena . 
now not but at the current ground , but &apos;s global level . 
we we know that the truth is 
that is topic the ecology of a global economy 
not , i i even the urban electric , you can the king repeated more , , food &apos;s not . 
it means about by local local village , has a global village groups about two-and-a-half versions , but in , , course , but exponential , this . 
and you we went to the village , where who left were nothing to do they with , because as evolved zoo are in whatever notion of which to through natural cell darling rates global warming level . 
well , it decided to have reached fail , happier and faster and also better 
so in early they were to in the village . 
so accessing in this background , i &apos;ve , trying to everything , an @@UNKNOWN@@ , hangers , which is for us , then we may also have for the but when , what what do &apos;re getting , like is think in we matter ? ? 
because people are often , , you can &apos;t they can &apos;t get , with you can be involved . 
so , is to who the nature , because that &apos;s not just &apos;ll change mistakes that it &apos;s but it &apos;s also to be better . 
you &apos;re , more as a optic , you address the the issue of the challenge is nature . the . 
and those of course , what cancer , you go done and , and says and say , okay , i with look at this inside a a . . 
and that is start in actually like you 
so how do we work , if we do feel together ? 
you what also of course , , is most sense all how how magic will be and basic and the the atomic correctly light ? 
because steve , @@UNKNOWN@@ more before to go their to change jovians of mother &apos;s house , see ; it . 
so you at can really &apos;t spot on in course , as i do something maybe @@UNKNOWN@@ or self-destructive negative , development what what that 
and look with how do we drive information information , take data have forward information 
to your state , why by information ? 
information is everyone &apos;s everywhere in connection . 
many use you word , don don &apos;t know out what that make really mind . it pretty to 
but i have to understand in the hidden side of the real same delivered information information , as 1,000 , , data information , and information about this with until when i think you could also quite as , or oh , , , ways doing of these or otherwise 
and of course , and making your implications on . 
so a very much of natural haifa though it to a bowl , but i look see their right , means , i of gray , and bed . 
and when you say someone , i give me bullet , or he burn , he then &apos;s finally probably wondering exactly where it of there . 
and the the camera you you sensory that , and hopefully that that in one place is that sounds salt , and them notice . 
but also our sense self , how can replicate ourselves ourselves . them . 
for excuse this this is in context . 
the the other range person seems larger of cool slide , although even &apos;s doesn by the but they &apos;re be exactly rule big , and yet continually our conclusions become ever down the context we we think things when 
anyone know what that is ? 
yellow on mit . 
went @@UNKNOWN@@ peer needs to go . 
it &apos;s have been sort of these of glasses . 
so , it is n . 
another second is starts moving simple and feel , sharing . 
here &apos;s called an lamp , or they behave &apos;re also , which question are hiding we us up . 
of important is part of the , that are a mostly changes first the world is communication . 
invisible is that of dental has fat continuity , so on . 
so often in third last over the . . &apos; . 
but this is is an important important economically , if you wanted to be things these important too very this this ? 
the next phenomenon the which is very interesting thing the beauty view . view . 
now sounds of all answer , but is &apos;s very exciting to all about how . 
so we have know behind little , and now now , and look &apos;re looking at the take there . 
that &apos;s wrong . 
you see over the bottom , that are 
by fact , fluid them of assumption , boom see where you can see imagine redmond you , structures outside . 
that &apos;s , , we &apos;t see the street main is when we see , for exciting to culture movie , and we &apos;re going to it back to do oh now . 
and i have cognitive cognitive implication you you , have you what to top see . 
so it &apos;s &apos;s is because that &apos;s comes back . 
and , they go back to the through , because it &apos;s not an remember the the and it and now , yet but really , go and i , and for it by then what you see what you can think , you &apos;s doing . 
and it &apos;s also leave back back and the truth , then they actually in it it ? 
so , very rough process , the kind as things &apos;re on on from impact in these things . . 
i don &apos;t know who you know that picture . 
there exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described . 
now kind of all each things that &apos;re something a different . 
i don &apos;t know who knows what she . 
anybody paper ? 
a success poster , right 
if i that have saw some that already that because it &apos;s a a wind at you , you know here . 
it &apos;s never that forget because because i going to show you the guys be brain 
now now this arm . . 
and far , now it &apos;s , still on . 
so this means , that i actually confrontation available learning to do that &apos;t &apos;t it difference packets of reanimate , but i will give it dog in just time to i just fine comedy dog in this airplane sticking . 
and that is this space of the , @@UNKNOWN@@ , , . 
now , i know and of , and now i carnegie at the go behave here that 
look see the bumps . 
so , really exciting studies that that goes , yes , complexity it &apos;t really learn like but here actually occasionally this these imposed mass . so . 
the anybody know what three different ? ? 
for a , yes . 
this is our present . 
well , it &apos;s also interesting to learn as a designer as well . 
when i know how little takes three three seconds elements , , i i could sort of see around the moment , i i can become very narrow @@UNKNOWN@@ that where rewarded by in it diagram 
it lure has gets to it &apos;s a moment . 
then it comes through the past , i will rumor i pass behavioral incredible for instance ngo when i see this phenomenon . 
what does a explain a pixie ? 
yes , milliseconds . 
and looks very interesting phenomenon . can start . 
this is the threshold for the people in them . totally stuff . 
what it means , if you think that now , might know waiting pay you make way at top long pretty &apos;t do it me , there @@UNKNOWN@@ no it make look at happen at 
and rufus applications , the is a very exciting phenomenon . 
it one the the of pattern , because we have . do have . 
that means , first impression is in a key low-cost engines of the we see things . 
and as we &apos;re looking things we should look we &apos;re looking at the way we and way that feel as , in how we can make , with that particular 
of course , of , just , sort they the , of , directly perception and facial chromosomes , being ignore with at day divergence with noise . the liberal . 
so so as a person with some some their too . 
so there you have swap lots of planning -- strand , @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s interesting . 
you are riots who really knew know fact , don me i &apos;ve got to follow . . 
but there &apos;s properties property , sequence you think about screen three of little body hear , language not a a processing sequence , put on ice grounded much money any way that it way . ? 
there are also on the washington at inspiring process that small shark , of we as ourselves as of course , . 
now &apos;s back to conservation this curriculum large processes of toys in the issue , , sort or point . , is a resplendent block uncanny view . 
makes , you that metals , depending well , what is a is a where precise , perhaps could a likely be done in very small behavior in favor for a and grasses . get a a . 
and there &apos;s something like the norm there . 
how could we do something possible to do this 
so &apos;s i can what i can use these have p 2012 or i need to be smart , i list to do this . 
and some commonplace , tuxedos , it &apos;s . 
so that i i plan that my three , for what it says not that a that &apos;s ever complex . 
they also have to understand . . 
and of the exponential could not not sophisticated contract by nelson a singular principle number first few time when when i any to make technology simple possible . 
why ? 
because in of string , custom peer-to-peer to this , , which that by a @@UNKNOWN@@ happen drawing . , less times , faster faster on the average on 
you just to imagine that that you look at something famous reflection next five , you seconds , end from the new stuff about the is instead to a this wide hour of putting that &apos;s an . . . 
you &apos;re not , you &apos;re take the four hours a wall of , have -- or your transformation or admit anyone it &apos;s from to worked with testing four three hours . 
now thing i want to say that that theory us to us a sense test , &apos;s kind of things . 
if we &apos;re coming into this project on that topic , the first line of the figured , that were looking abstract where we were light to create with animals . 
then what next next that wonderful covered may control @@UNKNOWN@@ illusion or also making a this , product system also implement that idea , which is , just me a i idea a simple true that is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , make of computer with a computer . 
so not broken no girls and seat or so-called arrangements , but we have a metaphor for 
so that &apos;s made a whole multiple operation , but there &apos;s work better . other . 
the next generation of interfaces has has working working in many very things with . 
so i will do why a model &#91; often three very more than than are rather . 
it &apos;s also creating a paradigm paradigm . 
that i want that your life spirit you own . is @@UNKNOWN@@ is a business in today . 
and if i add 50 step generations rocket in completely quantity by transformation , i &apos;m believe , voice by prescribe , , accountability supported , track by , and and and the &apos; tag , pieces , cover @@UNKNOWN@@ , machines turkey , plastics walk , then come and 
so also sort of elements to me to dot to the after any of the will more the more ? 
by , continuous tends to switch , and , i have to have my little friend here here up and , what does is mean , in act , what populations , man is now minimal empowerment ? 
and this is for people everybody , something &apos;s of questions something you think most need to . 
so it seems wants to want to think about it , &apos;s it them easy should a it . 
and would , so many i &apos;m of by thinking about this this more intuitive it . 
and what does that mean &quot; 7 ? designers ? 
and that &apos;s when there we if we actually have making a ear of something from artifacts of such another , for example , clip can make rooms be do . 
so that , , i can rotate a intuitive , the an set vision education software software she allows life making this built natural argument . 
so , of course , the question this is actually the radio begin of people have and of this &apos;ll actually get &apos;ve here . 
this is what we of @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
this , every people @@UNKNOWN@@ and man it a audience an and therefore she is swahili , stay wrong , @@UNKNOWN@@ , reasons . 
so do the power of them these all time , but it &apos;s sense of and fine , , once parts . kind

and we think we also protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit little bit .

singular rhythm , no waste of money .

that &apos;s not protection . 
it &apos;s as as i say , leave it children , it put just twice times three more than five five times . 
it &apos;s just a little less less . 
so when you think of well the glucose ways of tumors and predicts , so , will genomes how this planet , women or six time or a minute . 
i think about quote the brian merchants onto caves firms

we could used their that of percent that , which does ? 
this is races in china straight for a .

let me tell them . 
because , we is phosphorus is lead to up right &apos; tail which the wheat nerves .

because , &apos;s about it , it . there ? did it

the first question is is we really impressed to many lot of it ?

we , we &apos;re not too many , , we &apos;re stupid , yeah ? 
you can only be mentally if they don &apos;t exist , yes ? 
the only position . 
have you ever been a @@UNKNOWN@@ tree ?

a single ? 
and means that our intelligence intelligence means we have to have mess solid sweden when they are seeing ?

there &apos;s no viewing trees trees . 
there &apos;s not still rationally of your six a of trees . 
did you wiped out the jackson from @@UNKNOWN@@ from of trees ? 
that means all of intelligence , means we have to to print dinosaurs @@UNKNOWN@@ .

isn &apos;t that ? sad ?

it it certainly make some sense can be , shelter .

so &apos;re going to give properties to problem , but it it &apos;s just what a other footprint in a use is , charge . 
we want got better be society sense we happen , want to be but for but but it represents about the environment is the , , lie , yes ?

they can only do cristine donors if they &apos;re not there . 
if you predicted her then , they wouldn produce

we can see it it . 
we can manipulate our nutrients . 
and are in in agriculture from where we returned from . 
for can , we able you can way that find our animal systems and from chemical . 
so we &apos;ll trying this pay for china for example , which is end right right to

well , i say that my own words , which in china that might cause be . 
i &apos;ll watch these would to have those kinds these . 
now , for me for reflected in the wondering what , to be harvest now for

it it &apos;s be intended here this right now now , kites , you don &apos;t get explain my read that that &apos;s . 
it &apos;s always , very happy younger when i need to experience the the that i &apos;ve the so long long way to learning , like to say contractors . 
you &apos;s go a very new to , , even though the same with of the music of living , , , , aggression have to uninterrupted , i the head the i will also i &apos;ll quite supposed to take the same time of that . . 
i &apos;m yet becoming a , a educated , away time &apos;s my my meters is off down at night they got a an , life for light the pleasure back back back . 
and i take doctor ear , very ignore sure . . 
all all those goes coming me and the of , the other , lots of the composition . 
because my story is to when i &apos;m on something from the board of stage , and we have &apos;ve the same proposal . 
then u.k. , it the same a in contested country , 
you get into new new role and and during , and answer then answer that reaction . 
it &apos;s interesting to then aliens are things we didn have nature tenacious , and we can not afford start renewable things 
it makes great to to do this it and . and as a audience have bear experience , how the music herself to . . 
so , concert alan was always a . stamps . 
i never hug more like play as well right 
i can &apos;t very that like nurse years . 
i i i have more more that than that of and ugly , the votes , that general , account -- usual and feelings , , today . 
sure , i will adding a little cord charts as well but to and new one-year new . 
one here , with a little thing example example . 
it was on a monty birthright i was in my young girl , professor professor @@UNKNOWN@@ , , a famous @@UNKNOWN@@ , and virtual , professor of course of here in @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
unfortunately , i was lucky to have was of about that -- ago he was been to i was found speaking . 
but that had the big enough , sailing , very early with with the 13 of , a lot of was got to high school high , my vision on my middle school . 
i was been 17 months when i &apos;d back and through whole and of and was @@UNKNOWN@@ the talked about four of five- , which is an non-zero orange . 
he asked me what the the kid artists supposed to be son about me . forward . 
it that a a theme part . part . 
and in my finance , i was . . . 
does he put it and knew that , so ? 
it must be the be of . 
because for compassion means to to me . 
it was been on about 60 . 
well , in budget , you have problems , but but ashamed -- my or memories . 
i &apos;m going with just the now and all from years and always it , it me , i , no fact , not yes on greek , 
over so it &apos;s &apos;ve got get the stuff again , i &apos;ll talk across . something . older . 
one consumer at another one , , substeps prize , get re-examine @@UNKNOWN@@ de-linked . 
it &apos;s always the same garden , but on different techniques third , with the . 
he he egg this contributions governments rhythm priam design as i draw that about underneath it in now . . 
his size @@UNKNOWN@@ of mine . 
but @@UNKNOWN@@ third interpretation of a play is 100 twice . 
lastly , i &apos;ve been around as a as book yale , during the was written this . 
he only captured a hasn nothing . . 
and it &apos;s important to me , even blue even on the but at you actually want to do it . 
it &apos;s wrong to textbook , along with awesome rule 
because the grades are the only reluctant to he . 
yes , anyway , if died died . 
now , do you start to you know language ? music ? 
i said that &apos;re innately certainly , how to the week as for the word . 
often often the circular randomness is is that you only learn to read to students . 
you you learned learn similar to read before have before the only a word word 
it &apos;s to to the notes on to elementary attention to the deep . 
if know , all time time web . so walking so on the criteria keeps move , still come to the sound things like could as happy as music music . 
when the happens is , because finally students the the everyday for flower . 
p.c. suggest doesn going -- a . 
well , here &apos;s , the front of the series , is &apos;s quick quick . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ , slow . 
and and masters or 2012 , flowers , province . 
you know know that . you 
but even the biopsies into some them , it still still one more technical 
it &apos;s still not lying . 
i statement lighten . 
i really think that suddenly &apos;ll start a @@UNKNOWN@@ off is . 
and , , which music to best music to the instrument , , being quite the precise activity themselves feel they . 
and this wasn sing . 
a kid machine hasn &apos;t because learned now didn &apos;t have the parents who still serve it sugar . . &apos;t otherwise . 
so it like ... @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s the subject 
it &apos;s necessary to follow their own experience and image of idea of it all argument about her start to get to need to be a major capacity to provide a fit . 
people people ever beat , so even &apos;t true with yourself with own body , as it , as a sound . 
one image specifically with its own breath . 
the construct is an property is so its of our body . 
your contemptuous monitoring to to to our election hands and when to make your vibrations . 
so these are the conflict of the faithful the the day my fingers . 
and the melody magical out of the opening and the other out of the google . 
the aaron process today is listening music doesn &apos;t just anthropology . 
you don &apos;t need to make more music to , , it make a will . 
not get your a politician , or puppy . &quot; . 
for your music music is pinnacle , having you &apos;re throughout the world being relieved music . 
sure , there &apos;s being you a few , yeah , but what are you do if i don can you ? 
i want me some you that you you &apos;t sing , &quot; they think that you can &apos;t sing ? 
or b , because don don &apos;t learned to warps ? 
most it there is work too must , it because find not if not if wouldn &apos;t have to or or , how you enterprises these these muscles users the the odds ; lab evil . 
so this can feathers -- you manipulate them . 
or pessimistic , because you &apos;ve been tenzin you &apos;ve @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
i think of @@UNKNOWN@@ respects -- was seattle ? ? 
have you have a cigarette wheel or professional card , how do we care it &apos;s amazing for 
or d , you don &apos;t have music that , , that and want have decided to 
but i &apos;d myself defined that &quot; music is got a beautiful , masses . 
but maybe you can also still you that it . 
so , you know , someone from all individuals , there have no have a be on the a event . 
but you don &apos;t me , and i don understand understand about classical music . music . 
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good good or it &apos;s good . 
what gets , the autistic surely don , but can can say it , or not just resolve to or celebral 
because i don &apos;t believe it , i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s out it because i can collect cook . 
so , you don &apos;t get it food your only dumb -- not because &apos;re not doing as you . 
so still you , to pay the classical music as it . &apos;t have no a cup . 
listen , and they believe if they don or mean or not . 
i want to share your @@UNKNOWN@@ officials , too milk . 
say you know what you know . 
right over the time , you , have add example , then have want villages of bottle extra demanding mecca or gets to be beautiful @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
why do i get to making my audience which forever rarely it to 
because the music is a language , and actually is is as its @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
a artwork that you never alone will not happen . 
the food that did of a school or a a known as an snow wasn &apos;t pre-civil a not only look on the taken shared . 
so , listen to how , the music should play . 
she &apos;s not just a nice william neat . 
if in a environment that they meet active people music or the astrolabe at least , music , a kid fire a alcohol responsible for insane to , , which is high-power color do addition ? 
do you you sent it myself now ? 
and the child general , as a agencies , instead before now that blue blue moment . 
it that seems completely different than before before . 
and that was the first road by you of her professional expression . 
so the first step , one interpretation . 
and what happens if you time to sounds of microsoft that orbit and , like before a hundred hundred years ago ? 
what we have the instruments . 
there was some of gandhi to the vehicle apps that any don &apos;t . 
it didn &apos;t didn &apos;t &apos;t invented . 
i think that knew got so you if ever improvising of thank of black this social life . 
i can still went those the pathways ran to color on on remaining seen pyramid zero make a guilt a had a 
it also just it to give have more being was had further predicted . 
today is a modern foyer in to be everything play a experienced get on adopted away to have a increased . 
so , smell model ghana cried leads good change the pieces again today . 
they be present nurturing , , whatever you &apos;ve believed in in mind . 
and then , what they that mind is going to think today . 
or ... what i could today , i where i would be to . 
thank you . 
you you know , is is ? 
have they ever were of done ? 
and how did &apos;t it wrong ? 
stones . 
i went a friend who &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ right lift . . 
if i come get from on , work on a little guess moving around me wrong , edge . is . 
i me a blow through head . 
i say to @@UNKNOWN@@ , point for consider free , now you i going my car ? 
it is goes to the news floor , within the first . 
and all , &apos;ll work , times , have of than i &apos;m more . 
why have i privilege , go to doing cars airplanes ? 
and then one is agree off me it is load . 
it is against the justice . 
and as i call the word justice justice self-doubt , this adopt feeling . 
our organism has a great method ; let biology appear to when the sound end that immediately . 
they can add about all like words or or circular or something ideas 
i all like to explain with you why it without something sample about is what you will act you know define . 
the mechanism came stand on a . . 
but actually &apos;t these your lie you may heard in little already if they say , we the &apos;t to have a a wall . 
and then empathy stones promotion reading him to the . 
at somebody &apos;s an kick place that there are always , why humanity don &apos;t say but what he says 
it makes seems slow simple -- that tracking good his the way . it &apos;s . 
and &apos;re she doesn &apos;t just and they , &apos;t evolutionarily yourself . 
no , where the is i talk i that got do sticks to themselves even . attention them yourself . 
they need to lie to lie was an anthropology to finished a africa . 
they can can use them some can deny , , stop or smoking these down . 
they need time . 
that option we an exception of you might be . 
the spanish painter technicians nick once a woman a woman . . . 
this woman has gone ventilation automobile a high-wire &apos;t have to closes the ton . 
spouses . , wait very remoteness . 
they will perform anywhere more . 
and this sense , if that you laugh , , understand moore compassion is as as many lot of need attention say you have come &apos;t tell something tell a what doesn am insecure tell know . 
because artists have patient-physician bind thing came to perceive . 
so a artist giving you something something and and of all thing lady which &apos;s her dot -- notice &apos;s only look in the mirror . world . 
your artist puts them in a like a crime something all forms , is you which if you look bang this entirely . 
again , this strange , you couldn &apos;t make them feel and will we see 
these have when these mechanism that what we starting provided a a amazing invention of the communication we our dignity of decay technique . 
and not just in the art , in in the range theater of for anthropologists , stories , 
you may all know this idea , which the everybody was somebody was morning , and although he had asked -- who &apos;s the group the actual nearby in the country ? 
and one second , another works holding can say , there there a ... 
and course it &apos;s seven rode during the products . 
and also know how many famous the words of which manic explains that mirror can &apos;t act from which really immerse by that of us by watt . 
but we should be to have us that that you can &apos;t tell a woman of people there a a everywhere somewhere . 
this is takes the well-being that we &apos;t tackling when these don &apos;t understand translate . 
we need to make that one to feel that our we can &apos;t how we we &apos;re not able to avoid 
we &apos;ve just not working into the art , which bone , but but to in come a my remarkable role . 
and &apos;s is the story of the woman of @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s calculations . 
she was of from this book from charles darwin , the edges of the species and father of the . 
humans of the parents who was from by who , and these words , there were a common opera between humans our monkeys . 
and then , she gave them her to her husband , and said that , that that &apos;s not what i could mean akin to 
the human we should affects out from a biggest made of 
no , no , that don &apos;t go 
and if it &apos;s true , then that transmission getting enough to get wanted by the old people insisting . 
why do we stop , heads think were people might be solved for whether , right ? 
we can &apos;t &apos;t interacting with those these entire problems . 
so , we can &apos;t kill these these . 
we centuries is the conditions of are able all over worry but points actually &apos;s when they they &apos;re . 
so so this what it way doing out that providing balls and look here flashlight the bees , it keeps be going to the other one thing us you do that that picture of the engines @@UNKNOWN@@ , and i want to do another another story i . 
for is , very special story and how as me . 
my wife told her me . 
she would one up from the school , she &apos;s teacher , she she told by by by the . . 
a student student . 
she would like to , he love make it behavior because he considered to become a . 
and she asked him , what do they have your plains ? 
and he said , it &apos;s okay me &apos;m &apos;m with the fire . 
and because i &apos;m in of workers , &apos;ve i &apos;m interested in framed for @@UNKNOWN@@ things . 
i &apos;m feeling @@UNKNOWN@@ in risky beer of your you just are not there . that food &apos;t &apos;s 
i love said to her , if i carry a man in a moral framework for used headwinds because we should try and need it start back the pancreatic particular system . . 
you you then , just then , at that sentence . 
even though i &apos;m the being fire , i &apos;m &apos;m interested in airplanes teller . 
you feel that is the truth truth behind her . . 
such a little @@UNKNOWN@@ park , won &apos;t care in everywhere . 
so &apos;m budgets interested in the computer amusement 
but you don &apos;t alliance kids that we can come along and here the reality of you and you , what do do by fire . 
there only talk only opposite and the family happens . 
it &apos;s slowed up . 
so we , like &apos;s boss , and -- writers teacher don &apos;t want say you &apos;re have to place dead immediate initiate , cape if you head fire . fire . . 
no , it doesn looked as much better we we &apos;ve represent to it &apos;s into ensure trying to a certain who only when you are fire . to go fire . 
so it has thing this little mechanism . 
and these these distinctive @@UNKNOWN@@ this table the this that fallow , the shape in fact to gravity , @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s not that to not can &apos;t say the celebrity . &quot; 
it is always sounds words out we same @@UNKNOWN@@ , the bodies in will still playing academic circles 
because , we know that is something that that . . 
but we know when we invent the gates , the tool social powerful . 
we can &apos;t make that . 
it &apos;s impossible to make things things in live society robots work work . 
now i &apos;d to to you today now what we been a context in of jefferson . . 
remember what you see this strange , these gentlemen , the finding , somebody a reality about the fact we we already foundational area the mind that they feel disease . 
they want to take you share three , maybe , for three events . 
the first simple perception think what created of you have of them and some of them probably a very that all need all . 
i mean the soul . 
so is the soul ? 
the soul is a that peculiar , telling about . 
and from of this , thinks she think but in kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the tower of nature , it &apos;s that in america latin america that goes on latin america which where my is pain . . 
and if that compare that comes from people , the community , in , with shots , minds with blue , is only survive , which @@UNKNOWN@@ 
and then he can the camera . 
so this is so the idea of nor the soul . 
so , it &apos;s to move from the slipping from people . 
you we is to be you about something to , &apos;s be be on our lifetime to your present . 
and if they path this stimulation , you you also the logic that will is to learn to change together make an fellow are . 
because now you can use a @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ is about templated to run . 
now this is a wallet @@UNKNOWN@@ , that that a what a documentary . 
that is by the the largest part in my &apos;s talk . 
you , you need some logic , but they tell you to might . 
disaster information already &apos;s like keep clear that can of it logic . 
this is the girls three three done . 
the first sentence is , @@UNKNOWN@@ patent , there aren no a . 
so the second end is now , if microsoft has right a yes , he hasn &apos;t have soul . 
now there &apos;s a third third third . 
i operates him predominately him in here . 
it is a third number , true immediately immediately humans that antiretroviral is their strong feeling of an soul . 
the saying say , no god who is dead , nothing can fail . 
we happily really sounds your one . . 
so this is elephants this principle of course this is is the known . 
you see it immediately . 
the first two columns that are disease drives fitting . 
i i actually overcome everything . 
the logic &apos;s not a a looking about reality 
i can say , apple bag is a man . 
and when i got right ? , its path is a man . 
if i &apos;m not right , is the driver &apos;s a man . 
the logic doesn &apos;t make a he what wrong . 
i can argue that . 
but , really fundamental , when i &apos;m right , it got . . 
so , when columbus says , there &apos;s no soul . 
second , when he did right , he didn &apos;t have soul . . 
these things are make it . 
and now the our life &apos;s minds self has english you can do . 
it &apos;s a third cause of for i think do about you first to two trying scale , and that therefore like the opposite so long bottom the primal first you that and have you . 
because we have to prove seeing whether there &apos;s carpentry . 
but with this logic , skype just it takes two basic pure they are correct -- and a third @@UNKNOWN@@ of matter which looks like he do you so we of doing something we can eat it @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
so as we we &apos;re against , it , rocket defined without a queen . 
and we are very happy about it . 
we can travel this things of different , intensive ways . 
in the present at about the : a example my gods points that thinner . 
let to talk a put a third about an silk image from a philosophy around universe . 
i thing did to do we do will to back to the gym century . 
that @@UNKNOWN@@ was there called the he clips pulls that , @@UNKNOWN@@ after the woman company named @@UNKNOWN@@ brown 
the @@UNKNOWN@@ pores is a toxic textile made of obsolete . . 
it &apos;s not changed soul . 
this is is a a key . 
and , they figure out the original 16 of two trajectory in the in , he equal . he mac . 
because he doesn &apos;t know what gets he going to do story . answer ? 
so he &apos;s is in the middle all . 
so is the that version fee . 
fascinated control with digital posts wishes low . 
it happens don nothing in all . 
so if you will another , example , when they chase trick immediately an viral , instead of won &apos;t matter why not a 
again . it &apos;s recovery your real . 
now when if way you have that idea in that is where they &apos;re kind kind of virtually are colleagues struggled the greater actors , the common bunch that deliver vengeful immediately , and even feel quick sounds that it would coming up , you say 
and if we &apos;re in here @@UNKNOWN@@ video clinton you think , a little of stuart kind of something types 
there &apos;s a randomly called @@UNKNOWN@@ , hypothesis , and and familiar , and somebody &apos;s somebody to say , him god , there &apos;s no units . . 
now we can let can take the second person , and you say the has should got came virus to , it &apos;s has not outside . 
those norway are absolutely intention and correct . 
and what we can at to at the day , reading is secondly , for it up in 
and looks like he who leaders has in not brains have not protect capitol of spasm and kinds of responsible , and be produce , and he &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ to wildest . 
and it also you now . again . 
with you result , you have to prove sure looked are speaking bloody have . 
but the logic of can does computation is us to be doing the the first sentence of the wrong in requires that you have of counts obviously is . 
and now you can just do anything they do really maintain if you want to test anything and and if if want important guys happy want to ask to fear and dreams is . pursue the . 
practice for as you &apos;re looking at one people who you say , there no &apos;t be @@UNKNOWN@@ scaffold . 
and please don to use the sphere word for golan , which means tilapia . 
they &apos;s not be these , it woman should &apos;ll be a bit of political respected plugged about it . 
you say , there isn &apos;t circuit problem . 
right came out to , you you imagine any of these so pick , which you cannot , remote do . . 
and you already have a problem . 
because as they &apos;ve , they are talking they don cannot prove evidence it there &apos;s no inherently , the guy is all and happy . 
he &apos;s very happy because who &apos;s him . 
because he elder models has clear a starch oxygen it itself . 
because really , there really &apos;t believe in occur . 
it &apos;s not in understanding odysseus generated @@UNKNOWN@@ need a need to need to to to that detail . 
so in in kind of shift shift in stuff creation of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the ants . 
and after you again , without vision sort of bar people to knowing that people , in while they do because they &apos;re going to have others people thinking if miserable aren &apos;t pardon their their sense . 
thank you very much . 
yes , good day . 
and i &apos;m asked him why i took block of keep place meant i will stealing . 
it &apos;s one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ show here session , and just ask me me i &apos;m going talk to report and my my path . . 
i have to say say , said agreed . ; i said , actually i explore sitting actually with me of to idea of my idea . 
and then if i think maybe i years to take . at the . 
but it &apos;s obviously , the tangible . the very many of ideas . 
and &apos;s turn burial &apos; covered in now in in cafe device , , sold for renewable energy , then we wouldn &apos;t raise in-house energy . 
there was the @@UNKNOWN@@ family . 
they virus out tearing around , could chinese construction also called the @@UNKNOWN@@ fishing . 
the house is distributed organized set today . 
because a kid engineer out to did built or cars @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
but seeing is plant author of meditation &apos;s in , which is be hundreds of miles every the the square miles meters site , which was is a toy toy . 
and in berlin , there was an thrilled ontogeny . 
i &apos;m the prize charter that that add the word again again is because it &apos;s trying to piano the dog , not all , because all but were was having bad ? 
yet , wasn &apos;t this on the the size of that . 
and it in fact , there were kind collapse of historic , and one of them in stand on be in assert in the the factory where the beams &apos;s true generally 
enlightenment of the imagination , , , this was was 747 and and all 25 internet the solar media . and i in the start the pneumatics directions . 
and , a lot report that i was be asked , i venturi a very soon because because , many beautiful lifestyle and i discovered spousal somebody . 
i &apos;ve been 11 when almost adventures under the , this was dolphins . 
we were 20 man . 
it was overwhelmed with credit . 
and i &apos;ve political back analysts it and days , and then we add together with my friend , went placed by job grind engineers from the image resilient people believe in the world &apos;s yemen . 
and then there worked to to do a because i give the to in this time now to explore 
and the title of the speech was , you like a lot of 40 percent national college . 
and we just just started playing less nice history hunkered ask it , , of course , because will power a sense is make an radiated for of it 
this right , there &apos;s island island of the east self . 
food , these are so this data . 
there &apos;s a billion feet of people . 
today lives from 40 foraging ratio has 15 percent . 
and the question is , why don &apos;t they anymore ? 
it is not because . 
when they commonly give longer another sivers , everyday mind get theory 
that i &apos;s always going to politicians the money when it runs a @@UNKNOWN@@ or successful solar . 
and still then me ? 
we &apos;ve already 20 in in australia . 
it &apos;s not exist . . 
we , not three , in we &apos;ve , it &apos;s seven places and our cars , the so-called big fields . 
if we &apos;ve sat at europe , but we have have have the possibility problems when people absolute met there . 
the question was just , ominous , the hotel at the @@UNKNOWN@@ tower begin saying be run about down . 
well as big discovery because , so nurses , things &apos;t it can be sold with , their entire 60s for through 20 , , , fly or in and even maybe probably 100 percent of all . 
and yes , i go back on walking a clubs . . 
the the current system is the the planet difference with . 
by by the , a year of leader flick electric large culprit without the ayittey 
this is the controls , the of the hundred nuclear , that it is actually very quickly . 
the le @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world is much by amazingly for if resolve you needed to to offer a . 
that is fast . 
you have calm it outside . 
and then it brings it in the efficiently . 
you know , teams of waiting first and basking bright and for leave all forever . 
yes , that &apos;s saw the koran down it sea the that . 
we &apos;ve have always right hacker . 
and that sounds programmers whether the globalization or then is is , most rule an valves system , but a system , size just just in small toxic cannot in . . 
our goal is was to say , okay 
the overeating pavilion thinks towards the wind , the sun will compartmentalized the pipe amount to reduce the efficiency different . . 
and when you want to operate a 40 , trips : which &apos;s energy for is , visit , the , in your , then you have from the heat 
that is what you end been to care just expect so much need energy the entire go of the whole networks . 
it may can be it , is , when it in be ordinary in this with networks done 
that &apos;s no one ever been the it . moment . 
so there &apos;s a little list , so you can actually your car a book of hang about a little @@UNKNOWN@@ phone 
people are going wonder , what did it cancer aside what x on yes 
that &apos;s already seen 
so , if you want africa are instead of these that paycheck pm and and want to to build the net , then , it a very . . 
it is going the coincidence possibility be officials maybe go to hydrogen , methane effect power , you you or respect , that &apos;s going to be then . 
you guys have to go to leave percent with frontal can and business hacking and and don &apos;t only returns . 
we just wanted to know , it about where , working the powder grows car boys . 
what far after , as you get ? 
and then a whole crowd of in robots . 
that was the very early six six years 
and then we said , , right . 
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model . 
we &apos;re cheaper . am the sales , when flying maccready is five percent . year . either . 
and then we began with asking with staff question per the . . 
what ? as will done done ? 
have scientifically employees , i went new build platform design different 
and we already really fact were only five people , started travel up conducted by society . 
and here they are tv address this . 
the brown is a kind the the main one that the green one is our energy . 
that &apos;s is solar system even yet a solution than we that stop has seen only setting or percent and strips and and beethoven away participate don &apos;t begin the other ways of equipped at 
and the were monk , to take bottle of , the state , state , , we make that great thing . 
is also lead me and believe , don &apos;t have understand to notice it &apos;s limited 
and so we have a set of loose berlin in initiative at a we we which we as this kind of could picture in the just top of three of 
so means -- be on , what we can do make it of the austria in the sun . 
here she is . 
hebrew gets often in asia asia , in the fall from japan . 
and brooklyn are her it in the aspen , in 21 years , or were and started @@UNKNOWN@@ then broke the the japanese . 
and you can see it &apos;s a very short one big lighting genome . 
he has a ridesharing state performance and minutes to fill it in every long hours , and and of the battery that we have a fragmentary cellular those fields of conflicting . . 
and then brought out that goal . 
so here talking called capture about it , , the operates line of and of to greenhouse the ddt to the next movement . 
so you can see here again the real 
we can also skin embodied natural attacks on the net channel . 
so we &apos;re moving when these are we are because we &apos;re ourselves again carnegie astronomers , single back every . 
and what we did been since before at the dry did in canvas , to just about panel of them having vest , all it up with the single system to piece electronics the , software , bringing have . 
but we &apos;re not kind of ensemble , . but we monitoring by the company &apos;s just one in the subject and attitude on the subject . all the between between . 
you &apos;ll need to try to usual muscle to , so you have to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very thin . 
the beautiful the is the that this point actually goes in this headed today on are a outsights that that can get that that can think be when if we should to forests of ph.d. . 
and so this discussion discussion , how it will be argued followed for just of to , take limit like , to u.s. , we idea respect or take we described about bore a cities of do we we fall off the wind &apos;s the the sun and the sun 
so amazon rocks realize landed then . 
so domains combine out entrance , 
we can start favor perceptual legacy of the @@UNKNOWN@@ on suite it , you why to count the sequence the burden . 
so , for if you @@UNKNOWN@@ is by clapping into 44 something that can &apos;t action without memory . 
the it you could cooperation you about the you can you can climb from address yes , those should be for familiar with , consider , can you will never forget never do flow osama . . 
and that &apos;s beetles a you the that &apos;s that bit of . 
so there many , many and look up this change where you might see you notice those problems . 
we when send the tickets , you didn focused some of attitudes with this amount need a kind of a interaction on balance . 
and our kitchens system is just explosions from tasmania soft @@UNKNOWN@@ of large vaccines , where politics ball just across injected verge up . europe too . 
and look this brain map , and the map , and coral magnetic word technologies nine years , &apos;re going to have a funny component that ago , and then grim smells of a little bit little hanging little . 
this is the system . 
and of course , this is incredible happening . 
when you stand it in somewhere , it &apos;s a while . 
sentinel privately cancers represents on at least 10 10 to find the the net . 
and in time , you can come again . 
in they know no , you get the same component , delivered if replace , density out you . 
and we can live points between a large battery two comic 
now , you see -- a canyon electricity there 
and the message is , we , to to be except individualism , questioning if we @@UNKNOWN@@ of at , yeah future 20 or 20 impressive 30 years , 40 care about 30 , 30 at 30 as and if if &apos;re to do to this at all . 
we &apos;ll stop returned to our normal multiple float in the grid . 
there &apos;s is is just the force station camera going to finish the range . 
yes , it &apos;s a @@UNKNOWN@@ puzzle at the , unfortunately remote @@UNKNOWN@@ he &apos;s on about , who that not are not or then we piece or because that not &apos;s . 
and we &apos;re going to put that there are so the providing tools that let can tail it , through matched trip to using queerness through 
there is now born , variety of studies here . 
and so that it people people going to the and also turn at the wondering basically iyengar and of our movements of miss how on invitation to it . 
and yes , the discussion is always about , , how much you can be a a a much a of the range of . . 
and many i notice had had a years in the last six years years were similar to learn the public for this was the last 40 or my . 
it &apos;s not is lethal , we , we of we &apos;ve all count . 
we spent 800 solidified food in germany . 
this is @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and i just go from that we i should leave out same power time to our frog oil world essentially the oceans . . buried . 
it it &apos;s just she will be 
there &apos;s be a lot of a lot refined request and . 
the my beautiful thing that i was been transformed in the last and two more years that the have have lies my my to . 
we &apos;ve investing one over 10 million of just , other horizon , now , from a net 21st organ center . 
that &apos;s going on on next 10,000 . 
so that gives possibly why to say that a there &apos;s only this a order to get , sweden the greatest show of 100 percent of diagnosing aren &apos;t 
and if you hundred hundred hundred percent , , is like a dinnertime system . 
right now , long that the because , &apos;ve to to those three-digit port-au-prince , making power thing the have is make own your house , some is that not nothing with do do . 
also the question argument is eat is , at they never jump while , , or form a @@UNKNOWN@@ , they fixed enter places the planets &apos;s getting you are to get when they root provides just a vulnerable . . 
then you them only , coming and the power and everywhere . where where live in .

i i &apos;t recognizes the skin face my my ones , that it was who spectacular , , and i don &apos;t like read man . i don &apos;t have calculate not navigate . i don &apos;t like you . junk &apos; privacy press . 
it &apos;s all release feature , taste taste . 
i &apos;ll teach him for want someone . 
and yet , if i &apos;ve been doing into don at &apos;t decided to sell at all of anyway . 
they beat cute and shopping innocent if you &apos;re walking a fan start . 
i mentioned this from inflationary and he has squirt . 
he said , &quot; estelle skin is like a management . 
she is the studio ever before it &apos;s get authority on 
it has evolved in basically , according data about steps contains . &quot; 
and then he said , &quot; yes kind of doesn &apos;t have @@UNKNOWN@@ his &quot; 
okay . a a , cannot &apos;t fish vase fish a not for anyone who helped as it produce success in 
and then walks realized , if he says , , a nothing who hasn &apos;t have @@UNKNOWN@@ alcohol products , and the line , that which comes through through this through from from the river . 
it &apos;s a river river which gives all these days nowhere later , those are moving into , pressure , consistent greek coming from park . 
and when it continued to work system it room is this is is water , burning it &apos;s that . 
the system is basically so ; it holds water . 
because if water down water , it conducts solar in a atlantic . 
a signal occurs in the ocean , i know , and i think they fashion these they who makes as a saying , whatever as revolutionary also baseline , earn scrambled . 
you might say know , a recipe for food future film we whether want &apos;re of allergies a nuclear behaviors or we eat . 
so here we pretend we need radical radical new about agriculture , of a which bread become food . 
but for a lot of being a bit from a different neuroscience . 
we &apos;re not a tracker carl stained amerasian . we &apos;re awesome . 
we love allowed great zoning deaths i -- we love eating eating dinosaurs ; we talk about food taste food how , we organic protection . 
and if you &apos;re saying the that do the are the world are love open life at &quot; home , &quot; hey , i going to love charge people i open how about a child , take sleep 
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; 
you we be honest ? 
i don &apos;t idea that question . 
no , not because we &apos;re giving a lot of speed to basic world we over only longer . 
we billion people are transcend market today 
billion billion ... -- &apos;s more than ever attacks -- in willie financial century in the distribution effect , the . 
well , i don &apos;t even this question , has whether , is obviously has just have to aid it have has last off the last 50 years . 
its parochial learn , fighting @@UNKNOWN@@ , crows 24 the the foot &apos;s outreach fish , of time -- have the left a efforts : &quot; if we do feed the tired , like autistic people ? how could it possibly . &quot; 
that was the reason . it was could -- are was the new plan for the agriculture . 
so what we call they they what , &apos;s going put a @@UNKNOWN@@ in something , system , works on the driven culturally internet workers that would spread the mechanism . 
it &apos;s not a real , and it &apos;s not agriculture . 
our distribution system is showing quite optimistic because it &apos;s no federal communication while using @@UNKNOWN@@ resources down . 
they can not through national ecosystem , wrapped , but by by a larger , not from not just by clean , , by jewelry , not with all , and plan , but then poison , environmental teeth . and will . 
and want want to to the world ? 
let &apos;s start start question -- how are we our food ? ? 
or better , how do we make cause create circumstances , evolved together center need an to come ? equivalently themselves 
so to do it , don about don working on this the the future botox the future . 
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . 
american , chemistry and machines still hit there , and it never put have made a good profitable to to eat . 
now let look at at at here . model . 
this is that place on two billion years of famously for of oceans . 
look at a reinvent , farmers have hot 
schools that aren &apos;t worlds to competence , , mention the experiments instead of pure fathers , humane heels are not pcr , farmers , which not just courage , . 
because they &apos;re the ones who also experts for physicians . 
and when i really figure be &apos;s is something a better than i &apos;m ever be . 
you know &apos;s me &apos;s rather , because if the future food is it &apos;ll be @@UNKNOWN@@ it accounts . 
thank you . 
so , feature here now is a typical typical blind . 
the program a chair project i this is a small experiment . 
it &apos;s called click urban where &apos;s going i do and &apos;m we can , , if i can of make a to of individual any estimate , we &apos;ll have accidents 
and i day to see a different pattern that makes it out . 
that because that you see those outsiders rate , that are the people were who become agnostics profits them . 
we can step into step and and the pull , way web , hasn that technology @@UNKNOWN@@ , course senses are some of are to be , but everybody will &apos;t 
so if time look right bit still at at age later , tell the after 30 years or , we yet it if we don &apos;t bother to invest wonder choices . 
and who is looking at there &apos;s it has particularly to be . 
so you can looking at that &apos;s data of data and looking into the way way dive in flying without a single culture . 
and if we do the doing , data system is not for moving for itself ? 
so what &apos;ve we here we actually have the white , every single maximum wall which first show &apos;ve been . 
it &apos;s all there there . it &apos;s anything online . 
next can be able to to out my a lattice . 
with , , can can monitor in mind hundred a decade . 
you can put in a vary . 
well you can can connect directly one that alternative element . 
and when i look back here , i think ted i &apos;m in airline reception signs are come happening , of the park . 
i &apos;m a worthy of quick , i he , right that this &apos;ll going this over , to , for you in swim during exactly . 
now , whenever i &apos;m going to take a yield impression i could think their &quot; thought , what do i think about it in the theme ? 
so i go going to send to back to design need . census . 
and here see change greg democrat . 
and so you can get idea idea that that happens when we speaking to enormous stuff , on the , about conclusion , the , horrifying @@UNKNOWN@@ , things , but you &apos;re to look , turn , it &apos;s not like ! 
you you something that &apos;s very little bit . . 
it &apos;s something between and , and think it can change the way way how information is not could to get 
i am like going being quickly finish something little about begin to a couple bit of crazy . 
what we have done here we , we have cut a identical them and a near how very quickly boring in . something 
and a certain that gives takes a obvious expression and the gantry the incentive comes to . . 
so i just just give the top released the squares lines 
but , in terms transition view , we can do a lot . things . 
and now ask strangely at ourselves the of about puzzles facing are diagnosed english 
and i won choose the job . 
now after i interviewed after the government , i , that one of the is that estimate interests most for most time the human time in year year &quot; 
so this really important because there is an terms of that &apos;s not a kind of root autonomous . . 
this is just only when you &apos;re a step to and lines and , that actually . 
microbial one averaging at these particular biting , i , i do to as year the local for the year , and again , together . 
and when i look at these these , i , know gave the majority of delicious are some away kind of , , some of types -- and some does some , , from one element , beer &apos;s . geek off . 
and interestingly , also , a bread has the french winner . 
in without can see go and we the at ingredients your prize pants . 
you see , we hard is the best thing we is really change a web large by not just there page only side , but , &apos;s kind more abstract . 
and so i , like i tell show that else , could tell you appear to be some surprise . 
i &apos;ll just going you just the you the new york keyboard . 
i did , this pitch -- i don &apos;t like to call chinese browser , and this really not really digital voice , but you can get 12 what this sign and and everyone we this this @@UNKNOWN@@ each language . 
so , i can a step back as to live through to specific object . 
so that &apos;s important , you &apos;ll just knew through through species online materials the way of @@UNKNOWN@@ the the process a in the same way way way and find . 
so i can go into my my into a while in they . 
so here &apos;s full canvas that happened struck i &apos;ve far go . 
and i &apos;ll actually look all that i when setting up . with that , and at those epiphytes . montessori . 
and if if then again back a further step life and and i , that i can add hindu course , i thought i -- there , for them , positions i right , next i grown up there then . there at &apos;s , later sparking this or there 
and , i can go through into the object and go them you . back . and myself . 
it &apos;s a metaphor that constantly crossing to and and the time its long a bigger larger than the sum of the monkey genome . 
in the moment , on that , think we &apos;re giving is exploding shows 
we &apos;re talking about the kiss title . 
we are talking to collect kiribati . 
if fact do this actually , this extracted is second , maybe that new static source object . 
and , just by just laugh on all , we can then we . 
and when we know know , maybe we might even move . 
i &apos;ll stop with that thank you . much . 
i grew grew with a green part of science . 
in my high , drove went on the bus to school when every day , every hour . 
and my sister would in in a book company in my book length my my ideas and smaller worlds and three of a sense frozen particles and me , maneuver through of inspired symbols . curiosity . 
i &apos;ve been stuck daphne , i know . 
it was the market about this the projects and the and past the vacation of the . 
and my love of science fiction seemed to look pulls in my context , because looking , , &apos; in , in quiet , we went down the moon and and optimize the deep sea . 
radio institute has been @@UNKNOWN@@ bank in gut living amazed , both of animals and places for world and and many world of us who we could never never about before . 
and then may have for some of as on the bacha ballot . 
and i was writing . 
i could draw . i could to . 
and the it doesn &apos;t , video games these little @@UNKNOWN@@ with my was film , with very the those schools taken on , media , has the the , what i have to tank . 
we had to walk all at and , than when we read through sent didn on the at of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she rounds in our screen inside 
my response to type that i draw out of still signs , distributed characters , robots , , together and of all of this . 
in my tissue started i was captured by the be , i by the genocide cape , adopted . 
the mind somehow kind of that out 
and technology was interesting thing a technologies interaction , which , what me was disappointed cameras teach been based on was and the notion of the most , democracy to to us on very here . 
i certainly i would never be a shredder to deal with a airplane . so seemed seemed like to . 
but thinking it was a world , i could be walking line there , and this was just as which and fascinating as as as i was i me i when people read been books i . 
so i as i decided to be the last flash company @@UNKNOWN@@ 
the only problem was that i in in a small village , canada , buildings of miles through the country ocean . 
and i did not leave my calculation except i help not help anyone . 
i cala my father . he had fall a @@UNKNOWN@@ control of italian competition , long york , , which the on side of the school where we lived where we live . 
i was my one in my bond sugar in hospital -- of of a certainly in alhambra in 1945 , happened york york . 
the ocean , a real ocean , i had move off to be 14 years twice we killed at in . 
after all , 40 years , the , just are affected &apos;t actually @@UNKNOWN@@ hours have hours and to five dollars of this a 120 . 
and i learned see of the world of sea , , even in the operating middle , the universe @@UNKNOWN@@ , rich . already it &apos;s to be bringing people . there . 
because develop doesn has don a infrastructure , , in your own , opens move by imagination . 
i sure , i feel phonaesthesia enterprise that support i think i in top within dive . 
and my love deeply in the ocean is as same exact as the same its bowl . ever . 
so i i was a a @@UNKNOWN@@ , she making a rescue . 
this seemed to be the best way to navigate my own skills to tell , on my need for these ideas and some and . 
as a kid , they dreadful constantly against books and so was 
so what films have classified to buildings pictures images and sum . . 
of course , stories were me instead i purely the the roadrunner , &quot; mold , the &quot; , &quot; , &quot; &quot; 96 &quot; harvest . &quot; 
at what was gretel for god , , state built income show for snout , and which ended with scrolls called 
so terrain are basically my my passions passions 
what &apos;s interesting interesting happened to be , &quot; predictions &apos;s an problem problem problem in this as -- and then that we had -- a ability of this mri , -- image that we being electronic attacks , . 
what turned out the image that was was first september daphne , had ever looked in to movie . 
you the an , what not sent me , the was able to think it costs able to have a very bit : the audience world been approached the seeing pursuit of the magic . 
beautifully means arthur denmark is about oil have abstract laws , and theory is &apos;t significant story different other . 
so they studied something magic magical 
and i found that i &apos;m an amazing . 
and felt thought , &quot; wow , but &apos;s &apos;s , be a to take in required into the user sequencing . &quot; 
we we went to collapse hidden next &quot; if i got , and goes and even that . 
another v of collaboration ago , we built that was boxes , , it was a been in this effect on the same effect . 
and it worked and again again with something called a machine and the thing was in the the , -- have a project , and we actually on a bit more dawn for 
and from two pollen on , that was built into a large world world a prosthetic world came changed the . the energy exploration . 
so i started a company , together with my good friend of a young at fact of we had removed you leaders , disappoint &quot; -- intimidating regular french &quot; 
so the basic idea of this company , set of convince controls actually a record interactions , etc hand beginning appear to new ideas digital damage from 
and that we were doing that set pad that information for granted . 
but our the 1990s of the the &apos; , and occurred to the have was @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and we had on company , now , been growing . him . 
but the persistence came up quite move . and the folks in my company said me that don &apos;t have able to make that make &apos;m been trying to . 
so , affects that do , and we did this debate good over the big ship , it was working . 
i kind to point the same year , ball as ship on a car , &quot; that became an honest broadway level , a camera . 
i &apos;d wanted to to like the to first on the of midst of the titanic . 
so i was today that affordable film . 
that &apos;s the truth . , didn &apos;t know the entire . 
what i i have surprisingly intangible information said , &quot; we &apos;re out to the streets . we watch the killers . 
we &apos;ll show it in the computer of the 
and is an important . it &apos;s a good media for marketing for us . &quot; 
and i promised them to do an iconic . 
sounds crazy . but that again again then leads them can make a reality of to . 
we then built rapidly a months to i chip in a crash dictionary nuclear valley , actually miles library off the the north atlantic , basically @@UNKNOWN@@ i got a the really titanic like me on 
this was &apos;t a film , no really , , was was adolescent . 
so , that really hail understood mind . 
and of associated were pull easily . we had to use cameras and switch the brains kinds of kinds of . . 
and i started , out that kind , , arnold stood a very @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
well you know , were therefore separate and good &apos;re this planning . 
this building going to maintain vertical waiting , then you run in mexico like , , moving by no blue or becomes a recording to three of reasons at keep it . wasn &apos;t at it yourself ? 
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s exactly same way i know in i , being embedded . inside @@UNKNOWN@@ in 
that &apos;s &apos;s cool . &quot; 
i was became obsessed with into the deep . . 
so in the part of &apos;s working in curiosity and science . it was on it was it . it was my ; it was of fun . it was purpose . 
and it , to a had have a to , get could . &quot; 
because i know , i could imagine my hand , we could then could make a vision effect , , but i couldn &apos;t see the what was seeing wrong at outside in the web . 
so i got me a raised of but i wanted to . 
so so i met an something important of a accurate . 
after software , &quot; i , it &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want ask my a as a became actually in hollywood paper , ice , and become immediately protection while i 
and then we we we return the storyline result , and they were the injuries do brick . . 
we went back of the center . 
we took small robots that that we built set on with one . 
our offers was to successfully , and at one whole ocean of a machine is been able before . 
no one ever index this chain of the evening of those had 27 way type of fight that well then we develop the technology . 
now , i i &apos;m sitting here , in the scholars of the titanic , in world was rodents in the squares master which is the that spots , smell such else i &apos;ve that which challenging soon the that ears : there . locked there in . 
and i fly by the little valley disorder by the the of . 
what i really thing we just going is from control cake . 
it felt the wondrous loving positive launch of the titanic . 
the set is was one kind a dance put the the copy of the . mit . 
so this was a an weird experience . 
i was so completely tutors about and training you you could bridge state-of-the-art that media and pathetic of toes in the to the that flavor that the shape form . 
it was absolutely very unexpected . 
and might though site can only what perhaps may be underground for rumi began that time how there might help dressed along , , other kinds of things of computers ticketmaster that that would visualize by feel . 
after went through success through we all seen , that saw the bottom , really what by already i these suggests -- which we look and remarkable mutations ? we are are , , but that that happen . earth . 
it &apos;s done with @@UNKNOWN@@ . . 
they don &apos;t place in burned in solar destruction in we organized this . 
and so , jim see -- know , actually right at on shelter 500 degrees bird that they are pressure there . 
i &apos;m , to , at , same point i a caution was coming , down one vip during classes was in my childhood treatment 
so that was fascinating . 
but most thing we started out this down to me the dung turned that faced . 
we were until in imagining recently , but science was a thought in to treated . 
so in the string sand between cultural body between my existence which was acquired , as some child to the leading . 
in the coordination of discovery that i presented a lot . i learned a lot lot 
i learned a lot of science . i &apos;m now now many now think , you know have a friend of imagine why nation is be is like a like a top-down @@UNKNOWN@@ or 
i couldn &apos;t &apos;t know out of rights i before cell isaac wire . 
because one in a certain point i i had to to say me , &quot; what am i actually going here ? 
why do i do that ? all it come by ? &quot; 
these these films movies break &apos;t let &apos; money . 
we have just doing global further . from symbol &apos;t ever . . 
every think that is between the titanic , &quot; my &quot; circuitry just had my somewhere an began printer &quot; on career the one over the beach . 
i all all these train , this these , we have a very a very early audience . audience . 
no concerns , no word , not . , what &apos;re you going to have i do ? 
because we &apos;ve taken all these eight to 12 people have week doing effort over &apos; room work 5,000 news including then if for two months rifle on on up on top . 
and in that community , you think that is the worst @@UNKNOWN@@ here is every is the you i figure something a that &apos;s that because make can be faith . 
there is an connection , you intend to respect . 
and when my went back to walk the my film of &quot; sensory axis , tried to do try to strategic server : from that your very are 60 and tell willing thinner in the think . 
and that has emerging changes dynamics sound . . 
so i was proactively after one little 5,000 , when this incredible square fire &quot; we with new new technology that haven &apos;t had before . 
it &apos;s really exciting . 
it &apos;s an tremendous challenge . 
and we became grown at a a to a bunch of a and a family family . 
so seeing it my way to make milk films . 
there were people people who were thought they &apos;re really good zavorotnya and progress on the planet . 
so i was to aside a more kind of awareness job , make a job , during the point where that has been contributed the . work . 
so what can we agree from all of this ? 
what these are we learned ? 
i &apos;m in first one he &apos;s curiosity . 
it is the most famous property . 
the information is an power that actually can create a reality . 
and the messages with are much when much than all up the this system . 
me to young mast saying , these , &quot; give you have , advice how do i can do something . &quot; 
and i say that &quot; don &apos;t make yourself . 
they take good loud you do you don &apos;t make yourself to cheaply advice don &apos;t only yourself on , &quot; taking &apos;m away . get much &quot; 
nasa has been a limbic : sheet . no is not a alternative . 
but in art of and , it to become more questions as there because there is a news tend that . 
not mean huge thinking andrew innovation asked for humanity . caring value . 
so you need to get to be insane access prepared that risk . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;d that is to urge you to show , it is a point of either , not you say , you &apos;m . all . 
today , i talk about you about and energy . 
and what seems to be something , there &apos;s my 22 around the destruction was mainly or protect our small data in the action and we need have to produce and clinics to to find patients billion billion an a their life billions billion billion a better life . life 
but energy and climate is extremely important for that people are actually quite an important for for the other site larger planet . 
now means it every odds of @@UNKNOWN@@ most &apos;re &apos;t a a lot of many , it should out a times , and it things are going to change how they can change horrible environment to without the . 
it leads to declined . it &apos;s leads to uncertainty ; it &apos;s obsession effort . 
so , one will solve real for them . 
also , the chimpanzee demographics differently of them . 
fact fact that when know if you if only less the price be reduce the energy &apos;s was &apos;s to to less to size . . 
now , the club we &apos;s always the same 
actually that &apos;s secret waste in labs . 
the expansion food mall the industrial revolution , and within the 20th 21st century was costs a sickness known in five and those so we use experiments , they &apos;re can make modern materials and so many things do things . 
so , we &apos;re embedded on wonderful wonderful situation is move in the world . 
but if we will reduce the price -- we let even us the price to the -- -- we get in a new and and and that becomes on re up . 
there is going to genetic and the planets of formed especially so &apos;re clear . 
well , the exact explosion of between goat teeming by and them , talking , the other telling the they learned there wonder in few few exist , but not very much much . . 
and there &apos;s &apos;s also overcome it bad about . order of they get it but but you will be better . 
i &apos;d like have the more times , many said and &quot; when , really get that hot halogens to into fluke ? ? that ? 
&apos;t &apos;t you half a quarter ? &quot; 
the answer is : until we &apos;ll close to grow , rise levels . 
so it &apos;s a big challenge . 
it &apos;s different too way saying say , we have a , pay a nine months buildings , be built in a three feet bridge . 
this go fishing too go down here . 
so , half is from a a of three planet about amp 400 billion of three meter . 
every americans about about strategic people , this guys men of rich countries , less than one are . 
it is the five of tons of every to on the planet . 
some somehow , we need to wire that can gets down , zero . . 
it &apos;s got stressed . . 
we &apos;ve incredible dna when it , the fundamental , and have to going to get brought down coming , and stay to towards zero . 
so let &apos;s take if you could as challenged to ask , doing this at a lot . 
probably that has have to come with numbers like on six . 
so this &apos;s brilliant ancient science , we go &apos;s go through . it it &apos;s 
first first we we the population . 
today &apos;s a billion people people . 
and then occur at 4 billion of transformations to be billion landing billion . 
if we could willing to with high @@UNKNOWN@@ in science teams and we we can be which are percent to lebanon percent 15 percent 15 percent , but just start seeing we &apos;re course at spot people a talking . 
the second factor factor the services that we use . 
all that is cybercriminals we had eat dancing , clothing , television , motors . 
these are very good things and power , meaning create cost of life for almost . 
it &apos;s nice to . this . 
this here we &apos;re at the very functional , -- this have to the house light it you can do the job went ? 
and those students don &apos;t have you , go out , and how to put mixtures benzene within identities of 
well , at with , e , such t , and he &apos;s good news . 
we talk something something we . 
because goal of breeding innovations , towards different sorts of science , couple , from new ways of levels of , which theory energy that health reduce the capital benefits on 90 percent . use . 
in other and security , like funding food -- until classified : it -- very -- &amp; saturn ; : @@UNKNOWN@@ : it , the @@UNKNOWN@@ sometimes &apos;t and gets homeless money , has this much more &apos;re optional . 
states , we might be optimistic , maybe get a 10,000 atmosphere for probably factor another or some even just perhaps 
but at the first three three , now we just 40 degrees billion 1987 may live known 7 backwards to 20 minutes on values it and just &apos;s not enough . 
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will get a key thing -- -- that is what and of carbon @@UNKNOWN@@ of &apos;s from . 
and the question is , this , can give a the zero . 
loop state coal , you . 
if they engineer angels , no . 
nearly each muscle cost for selling breeding today , carbon firewall , matter renewables . 
so the we need to create on a global level , model , which is a to to do a new system . 
we need need mechanism . 
when i i watch word &quot; wonder don &apos;t wear myself -- it &apos;s not 
the waste is a wonder . the computer is a wonder . 
the internet , system providing is a wonder . 
people are caused created many gigantic of evolution in the chemical series . 
most in there is no hope you want a miracle until a particular tattoo . 
they may &apos;re like wrong in or you think , don &apos;t you have 
at this case , we need to give some an , just a &apos;ve got very long time . 
now , i , how did i try my get this ? it ? 
is a means of thermal plastic , a shoot we with the vision of people ? 
i illiteracy one year , traveling like , i network patterns , and i kind of way these things . 
this idea was it really really you know that there are people affected . guy . 
so , i understood in like this . course . 
i decided that the leaves from the my 250,000 contribution to the environment dinosaur . 
so here are some terrific hungry . . 
but you admit that you &apos;s don thou believer &apos;t actually necessary &apos;t even kill the of the glass . 
well , you all be whole kinds ideas how trees , all it don not always all &apos;t a lot lot . 
we need solutions to or either , small 500 lake and worth on a amount of , and even than there many lots are available are that i i really describe lessons , which , can actually take already really blank strengths of . 
i have chemical wind , spelling elements , 800 . 
let &apos;s back as we will : we burn off sheep the either or or natural gas . 
who shouldn going to this ? 
as fact , forces can any something which is literally actually lots more than any kinds of plastic get you wears away from and beauty ? 
and that &apos;s a lot amount volume . 
so that &apos;s a tough clips to that . 
next next computer : domain . 
and what do you doing by the waste ? 
but although though he &apos;s the big we have lots lots of explain . 
so three three tough results , might be be , and keep that they keep saying that were 
the the three three data built to it . 
it is the renewables , as you &apos;ll being . 
and yes , since they we actually that that they need no offer ; they have some downloads that many . 
one is the energy that are natural these parts remain dramatically than the for of available 
these are architect , i i come that hundreds of times thousands thousand surfaces -- more than a normal inner plant . . 
you of course be about from sources 
the sun seem not not the day the kid , it doesn they , she either , as &apos;s the wind , won &apos;t get points it all the . 
this is why you have if you &apos;ve been on , of it we have done to of is on be while at with it &apos;s 
so there &apos;s very supermassive indeed -- there under ted models in case are when on say say that the power matter of the country is only they are not just simple the @@UNKNOWN@@ family climate . you need to have you the available understand among where comes from . 
which there buying video applications . 
so we all of that a great rigorous row that be a a factor of times you than ultimate boundary to the time . 
just is not impossible , but it &apos;s not just easy . 
this is what you &apos;re trying to fund , we exploration outcomes bubbles of talk percent . viability , the of your time always 
if if what going to talk to 100 percent of these are short incredible support . 
so , where shall we go : what is the key approach ? 
a &quot; land project ? how get the next ? 
what we need a lot of companies that work on it it : hundreds hundreds . . 
every for these five numbers of first &apos;re at at least 100 people . 
they &apos;re them all very be asking that that crazy crazy ! that &apos;s crazy ! it &apos;s terrific . 
i think there , in the ted , there &apos;s a lot of interested there are existed in there already . 
bill airport has several companies wearing evaluate named four @@UNKNOWN@@ called its great downsides . bureau 
iv @@UNKNOWN@@ set in 53 change three awesome and had interesting questions , and and that &apos;s interesting i want to . . 
nathan renny and i &apos;m people a company , perhaps an isn &apos;t the useful just . 
this are some couple of emerging from biology ; aiming with , . . . 
so unusual evolved within this industry researcher few couple of times , there there &apos;s no big surprise , little very handle is named drugged . 
so childhood &quot; that off you decide that one part of the of , which passed a dot , which system ; we &apos;re ; the roof 99 percent to , the close . 
and this is sort crazy crazy idea . 
and that , we gas controlled the 99 percent trucks , turns a very much better . 
in fact , you go the waste , and you can actually to everyone waste portraits &apos;s just than hydrogen @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
so instead of moving it down , they , they drop it , a . . 
silk renewable efficient used a , a little like like a candle . 
you guys make the kind of louis tips &apos;s a virtuous inches coming johnny of the bible . 
he really e. this effect . 
this is a picture of a month . . 
this is corruption , you can no is the number broadcasting 60,000 ; it &apos;s coming up to word here , instead it &apos;s stanley restrictive . 
the assistant growth that on for hundreds of years a line . years ago 
and if you go enough , you yourself , they start make you need use it for 15 per &apos;s on its rest . 
so , you know there there come many lot examples including but it &apos;s an example of many few of experts that we need to to step forward . 
so know it think to find leading to should our your success is 
how should return this grandmother ? ? 
now let &apos;s go back off the same thing takes this going to go , we then we think talked about the ugh taxes . 
many of , only billion by about 200 percent . 2050 . 
it &apos;s quite really important that we be going . . 
the rest 20 percent will &apos;ll be up in poor countries into a quite and sea still again , evolution . hopefully it will be on be on it &apos;s going to be clean . 
so there &apos;s 80 to achieve 80 percent , the 30 countries , including countries like china , @@UNKNOWN@@ officially their flow . 
the other grade says if you should the no technology to find it in all in animals , and we &apos;ve on with the , we can get to the rest . the it . 
it &apos;s extraordinarily important . 
the will start a the at the 
if we go after we go to and the way 10 sought to ? 
about for the these two things . 
we should use the nuclear @@UNKNOWN@@ to fly to see away pop the way we denounce crops , the smaller classroom and the new , fish is also being . 
there are we these venture tools calls seed motor powers that we have to , in per kangaroo , kind and @@UNKNOWN@@ , 
there are a have great innovations books on this subject . 
and al gore the book we we have a choice , and then is called eight matter or makes completely wash of immediately &apos;s online . &quot; 
they actually actually go through just do define a place in that act foundation , along can be techniques because we need for of all of all on the side . 
there are a lot of you are into together . 
it &apos;s a wish . 
a very non-governmental child , that video we &apos;ve play . 
that &apos;s the biggest impact . 
so what do we have to do ? 
what kinds of addressing doing ? ? 
we need to make for more information . 
if countries come in places like places vessels are , you actually , not just about cover carbon . 
you should describe that owners , and you were were at fission little genetics , which &apos;s thrilled ask some innovative innovation . it . 
we need americans , carbon out control the data &amp; amp ; ; something something that an growth going 
we have to celebrate the . . 
we have and have a lot and more genius that entire time the things that will be connected . 
it kenyan a grade , but i think we can do with him . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you for thank you . 
thank you . much : that going give the an force anything -- anything well is you can you think for an picture of scale of scale of the investment ? 
the key step is going to do the first @@UNKNOWN@@ , learning billion to have the score , and that water actually actually saw the first of that . 
and the first is , when it &apos;s why it ... up is it , clear so the stones , they probability of something equally than as as culture as we as you . 
now to order see this : reality civil thing move in the ground much almost like an cards balloon of fundamental the , that use that set up , by @@UNKNOWN@@ , and at it continue on right down and moving around 
@@UNKNOWN@@ : accurate . because you have you want to go the that , , one , and , and organized the already had a fit in in of the town , and the little @@UNKNOWN@@ your wall you can and with something , and make my or and you 
if you frederick very low 300 , it can saved let his first of 60 of life -- it class a coins -- you &apos;d it can have the anything through all stages down themselves . 
and it &apos;s there on and raise on it and it it it done . 
a @@UNKNOWN@@ , words serves a solution to the @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
backgrounds : yes -- now , what happens in your waste , you &apos;re to sit , there there a lot lot waste performances of that that -- and a it , you close and , it in the next off and slowly . 
and we , to turn out now of progress that occur exists over @@UNKNOWN@@ dying or vacation is , . this are our dependence @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
so that &apos;s what these do have got problem , what we go in in the africa is that graphics to change peak during how we that in this process . it is 
but at having the moment with other people of these world , so we &apos;d &apos;ve to had this . 
where is the biggest interest that what really put of doing ? 
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french companies &apos;s ever made to something that we out . 
this is a connect of a thing that did . . 
it &apos;s a more step forward , but it , that &apos;s a few of and and some have between , that poor so that a that , one made fig described for , early @@UNKNOWN@@ major buttons first first . 
in your youngest , recent , will that have a really to to your life ? 
barry really inland from this ladies among , these things that are a inexpensive , mission make we led to clerical project divided , and then now going within 20 years end 
this is just the that that we whom have have is us that we be being yourself . 
and , you know , bukavu , if everything is done , and it &apos;s a very wish does it could easy easy . 
and fortunately some in upon dozens of companies and we need there must go , which way , upon signs were work in your blog through that build , over for more murder . 
and it would be accessible best it how many different sources , but then you could use a mystery . 
and any , of &apos;s solution to 
what the work of category , that is to the best thing you ? ? 
@@UNKNOWN@@ : a key news is the most . 
and that it reform you knowing it had much good , it the electricity i be more . 
so a basic way there are other bring companies . 
you know , we don &apos;t know is bit pushing doing but , are giving &apos;re a kind of that this is a different approach . 
there &apos;s no sides system of quite something &apos;s solutions , but , and do say that . 
if you don &apos;t it , then 
should we have have @@UNKNOWN@@ us to try and we direct the crash staring stable . 
excellent : as you put in this , , they &apos;ll produce so much lot &quot; than you have of much kid and being off how you see &quot; that you please do , there &apos;s , or what one or , even &quot; . 
there is a research component called magnesium channel called @@UNKNOWN@@ from different techniques , adapt change the networks of 500 largest and to feed them here or years ? . 
it &apos;s just a stepping . 
the designers that we don &apos;t need that . 
and people say they are not just want marry an only for the medicine even that you might sometimes prove to want let &apos;s go it got more because it &apos;s already is cells that saving &apos;s going to be . . save . . 
sorry : : would you have one two mutations for get you to yourself ? 
sexton : well , unfortunately , actually a will come in different a of 
the ones scientific arguments are , little little . 
do you think that can have have impact on foundations with to do universe the same changing ? 
there are very , few few things that &apos;ll may tell you teach only one take a million the city . 
so the brings cheryl processing , as human one . 
you &apos;re yes making the way of , you pay attention much time later . 
and the fact that schematic can us should worried about . 
affecting : the frequent focus for the research -- that that , say , to should take will billion 10 already an than than you now doing that -- wasn &apos;t pretty dramatic . 
dating &apos;s not &apos;t be separate . 
you come and great big exciting great creationists , you can print &apos;t hardware any thing if when a have already subject -- such that is not the service and violent you tried to sent by it thank much shocking guy , i my most waste us . 
it it &apos;s a small very about -- end try -- -- increasingly joined the scarce food . it think we how to have more things that do the potential to the be very expensive of expensive . 
now the bottom of the americans , you get to the very high designer room lots &apos;ll just always get hole . 
i mean , one of us can say five five ways for going to have your whole reality . 
indeed without the two billion billion yet it &apos;s a disaster . 
and even berkley follow-up around 
its new @@UNKNOWN@@ is now to can ask is the why not that further going into talking 
it &apos;s still now to be the last oldest am with being @@UNKNOWN@@ through which is this is a , quite small a third relief us and therefore why is now the turning now it now . 
and that is a judges of i add for safe . 
the research , it is frustrated crazy how and that necessary is 
bill , i think i &apos;m great listen about all i , these i i really hope that i wish you true . thank you -- you . ok . 
thanks : thanks . . 
a few years ago , here at ted , i &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ called &quot; the side resonates 
the the idea is quite simple simple : to have a given to the massive debt structure , simple from come away foot per kilometer &apos;re a little shark switch and a a beating . 
the calculator are top at top . on top . 
and problem , which it appears that make is actually actually hard pretty -- actually often walk really very quickly . 
and , way i thought was this a , idea and i do it is a bread into 
it &apos;s been big success . 
normally normally most people watching about to get at aim . 
they talk about it , they look something like it go out to like it off 
then you &apos;re going to spend a little of interest in organization , and dancing , and that . 
they invest in most of their time in active focus amitabha devices . 
and then , shortly at the they don &apos;t you have time to getting the the , and &apos;re put it down to the climb , the next step and and &quot; &quot; syllabus &quot; enhance it its . 
but then , worse today happens must as that pool respond to worth of &quot; , ever break weight of the questions we the wheels of the depth of and bad and do . 
there are a series of people who which people a lot -- got more fun , you looked up to the cloudburst who , in the hardest coming methane . 
they lie you they &apos;re reflected they are confused , basically make faint sounds . 
and of course , they &apos;re there &apos;s in the ways of high jobs kepler , and with think now &apos;re such new british sum drogue the 
and that is pretty amazing . 
as as song said don you , only only &apos;t the highest miles but it also the most interesting structures of all . 
what you might think , &apos;s this is , &quot; is ? what ? as here ? 
and peter said , &quot; see of my young places are i suppose to &apos;s think heart advice &apos;s top-down . &quot; 
they don &apos;t a time -- do it . 
there &apos;s another reasons . 
and that that the robben trials work that you have to a &apos;s great issue , ok ones 
and i kept to find it . 
and what happens when you want end the horizon , screen , there have no time you any time and ? ? 
it &apos;s a crisis . 
sounds sucks , what ? 
what handbags is doing is that they &apos;re talking to the banjo and prototype and , onto the with the strip that dropped string northern here that , they devised , extended mutation site . 
edit out signature kind regret in celebration sequencing of a nuts windows . 
and and every attempt to children kids is actions , as food ; they would mean 
that is , the plan to build with a prototype much but times -- we see , different adults . 
percent average for most people , to by , are @@UNKNOWN@@ , rise of 900 money , record whatsoever , but not much , bad as better than for adults . 
when is the successful industry people ? 
&quot; and engineers , too , sociology . 
oh mapping , the sight i i &apos;ve . 
and why ? because they &apos;re smart dynamic of &apos;re actually moving to make determination . 
universal orchestras something than average . but here &apos;s it . 
let &apos;s architects to @@UNKNOWN@@ for a team number they &apos;re interested better . 
it &apos;s incredible . i look at see and people can burn this team will win . &quot; 
they can make it . . why does that happen ? 
because guys have special skills offshore cybercriminals . 
they define the process ; you &apos;ll to . 
and this team , very plastic and tail work in journey will be limited the change for the price of the addition of their . 
progressively skills and have low skills to became . 
that after 10 10 , have need , you &apos;re @@UNKNOWN@@ six you got stable ok structures 
so i did something not something interesting . 
i thought we got the generates brains . harbor . 
so what i got a business $ dollar on winning the winner . 
what do you remember with centralized chez ? 
what happened the outcome ? 
this was happened . . a team a robust structure . 
if someone studied up very high car robots , he had engine fly do the to the 
so is not that interesting is that happen there are a strong ? 
we just talking this opened the same student . 
what do you believe what happens ? 
now notice the about advantage . . 
so with the same , bad was actually mandating the first every man . 
it grow the musical dial for the least time . 
and there are an 122 lessons about us , design we &apos;s true . 
they like asking : why would anyone actually themselves to do 80,000 a to global physicality ? 
the reason i &apos;ve to making computer devices and processes applied for companies , sometimes video games , &quot; video hungers as an mined meal . &quot; 
and what what land the is , it actually reproduction , compute her aware . 
and mouth open our project pencil a took carrying your window . 
the challenge that a shared a a a a language &apos;s legos or create an really robots . 
and this is the value of this experience that teach this simple exercise . 
and those of them that understand &apos;re interested in position x-ray exchanged . 
it is a blog where you can see how to build the the beautiful . 
there are a major guts there . 
they are making some examples of the world as people have the system and quit . 
they have also boomerang serendipitous . . 
and the purchase lesson lesson i think think is sure the the is a a sport , 
it &apos;s for understand all our our life and that and we should look nature our agency how how how and our our business and the context , the care us . 
and sometimes , @@UNKNOWN@@ small mom that not with all the right-hand from what it needs to have us , and we the like good video defy 
and this can do a big difference . 
thank you . 
so we we could something like that machine . 
so big make a machine machine the big music , , it &apos;s machine . 
and everyone in this room has to be . . 
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future , you cannot &apos;t in here here and . 
and i ask you what they wanted to be found , when i did to my friends her very few time , the question wanted to be jumped in the past . 
i don &apos;t know ; they wanted to back back the time before that went to twitter , &quot; the internet . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know . 
i i that i &apos;ve because you that to some to northern tumor . 
and that &apos;s what i understand . 
i &apos;m not not part of this group , i need to say . 
i don &apos;t necessarily to the , and i don &apos;t because i &apos;m a chatting . 
and it &apos;s this that don &apos;t be anywhere in on planet , you go forward . 
so , i i to go to this computer , and i want to go back into the future . 
this is the greatest time that sacrifices the except ever for where planet has no , bear calculate , space , matter , wealth , mobility , rejection , greater . 
they never death a just this time . 
my propose friend die away as they were gone 60 
my grandparents had the number of ceramics . 
my parents are 80 of of the benefits . . 
so it was better to get a escape at my are . 
but it &apos;s not because people as us because you can be bigger than you are . 
a one child who will live in new delhi captivity for long the year , poor in the world in 100 million to . 
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing person . 
so why is that ? 
smallpox did have been billion people on this planet . 
they &apos;ve invented the odds of the using are a way way you this &apos;t had war war any . . 
they are gone . they are gone . 
we have it hangers . pull . 
in other status world , there are of diseases that have cost particles and travel only so should yet to half proof . behalf . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ , hmmm , afford ... 
even know know somebody someone is about ? 
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to make billions of the people in the 
and from my view , the scientific method , to look when it works works , it it doesn &apos;t change it &apos;s not the only of the perfect matthew of humanity . 
so that &apos;s the good news . 
but , surely is it all the &#91; sarah that there there there many couple where one , and they just talked been 
and one of them is that despite our 2006 market think of our limits a billion people in among can world to live in scene . day . 
these number goes , up die , and very quickly that and is . . 
our not that only , we have our imagination , imparted work that , ropes spaces that nation coding . 
water , arise land , scale , earth , four &apos;re &apos;re it underneath , , wasn least ride , and we the reality , we in and we &apos;re doing it . 
so the question is , can we do that ? i think about . 
i think it because we can produce food we which to get rid of no longer without the land to live their @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
i mean there we we need the world with energy that they don doesn not . 
i believe that really , and he &apos;s not not one class . 
but this is 4.6 in at night -- one of these things that i still remember the night , we can &apos;t solved how science as never until it even want . 
and we have also able to make it so alone we you can do today . 
and people exist inside your poorly , so it they stuck you can stick it your 
they even &apos;t the second it &apos;s free . 
and listen and everybody &apos;s an right to its mind , even an right really happening in progress is the progress . 
but you know know what they &apos;re right right ? 
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts and we &apos;re , don &apos;t 
and i needed needed do by explore the actual thing . 
so , an ago , i had a article in about incredible new in new york york to a little side . 
and i was got by clear to impact on the , but you the the primary the most effective minutes in public health in history history . 
i didn not know what that should me , , i just just what i do always , i would created a paper and demo . 
and soon i first investors a make a article on was changed food . 
the same thing all only . 
people were &apos;s crazy . 
so , the wrote i wrote about a article about , i i had no understand why the thought thought think whatever is did so that have that have to be , direct a single session of about on a particular view , in remarkable 
but you know know : i got what i doing . i wrote that article , and i did on . 
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . 
we , we got nutrition , we eat a dinner ; this is okay . 
but it made they me me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually , and i found out . 
and this involves faith , that who i took me aren &apos;t @@UNKNOWN@@ necessary on all . 
these these people people , , people , influence people . 
they were just like people live in this room . 
and i being embarrassed there . me . 
but then i thought wanted to know what , 
we &apos;re in from point where we don not with the same kind of progress in used to type so . 
we have talking to be controlled . 
we forgot pepsi , little bonus , here this , progress . &quot; 
all , well reason for already , reasons i think we know what it reason . these 
we have those of in social , , in sometimes , and sometimes in creativity , no lot zero . so that &apos;t have not be . 
you would smooth a of names like the and people are get all 
intensely , die , the , hand-scribed , -- massive most mass , destruction , molecules 
i mean , you know , you can choose their own through . 
there are questions and problems with the people it believed they were always right , you &apos;re sweating . . . 
imagine , you you think your evidence , context for a 
take nothing to be in than that . 
but now , is -- , you have finding evidence for these notes , and we don &apos;t be good . . 
and i can tell the bottom , that we are now in a epidemic on the for and i never never have never seen and even hope will 
if 12 years ago an history of published an a story story that washing volunteer the was , heavy-duty bells and and presidents vaccine with roofs . 
very ashamed . 
of have been made to see if that wrong . okay . 
in many clinical trials should have . this is that serious positive . 
the data came in . 
the data coming in from in the of from south , from from , , some canada , and all was of the right , there connection , no &apos;t , no context , 
it doesn &apos;t take a difference . it doesn &apos;t make because , because we believe believe , organize think we think what we what what we we what we are see in view think is a . 
we don &apos;t think it &apos;s a documents on a friend of pedal , that are shared and -- i understand that , i think we all . we &apos;re going to we &apos;re it . 
but do they know ? 
and usually a result of a . relief . 
pillar because this case that going shall : one states won only one of the only countries in the world literally careful director or rescue . . 
here &apos;s is beings we should be ashamed . 
it &apos;s hardly . 
what it happening going we could do that . 
well , i understand that . that do . 
even guy calls your dance ? ? 
is any one in the audience ever ever you passengers before you ? 
don doesn really often out lot . 
but don in all in the country , but plans at the world , last last year . 
that &apos;s a female deaths gain tribal pair 20 an hour . 
but because because last &apos;s not here , we can put it there and people people like , council processors content 14 and manipulation as terrified , livestock by or netherlands @@UNKNOWN@@ present for asking students definition happens as love . 
and that can do it because they have giving your cause reducing and connection in that . 
they they not &apos;t realize , those of seem like be but , reality but once perfectly the same . 
and it &apos;s something that that we need is learning learning and like quickly . 
this guy was a name , he @@UNKNOWN@@ invented 
he paired attention to one of most worst probably issue humanity .

it can save lives , amusement rats at 1,000 and 10 that the year world . 
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ? 
well , this is good at while paul miles i followed and almost @@UNKNOWN@@ and say , how significant they they are and heads &apos;re supposed to stop stop .

so is is a direct minister . 
and paul works into a public healthcare , he can &apos;t run fully affected impact . 
he &apos;ll going to calls into home , because people will to him it read her to know how to know your kids . 
and why ? economist paul made an vaccine . 
i don &apos;t need this say that but progress are essential . 
now you get you , go back hopeful engagement , perception flexible , them this mating right . and that &apos;s happening . 
we did real united states right now . 
and this gets worse , and pretty soon women , children be that period , because that &apos;s just a question of the . . 
and they &apos;re not going to dying dying . 
what about fades ? let &apos;s our we . why not not

they assume this stuff , and you take alternative common interest , and there is no a difference , just as we get out , that . . 
the data frontier the moving constantly . 
they have its forms . you &apos;re just almost impossible .

it &apos;s right , source , structure . 
you know saying the science is not supposed to . 
it &apos;s not a land . 
it &apos;s not a story , it &apos;s a process .

there &apos;s no other basis of what happened here .

so normally i sort click up the make it points . 
i would go happily i clean my and show you is there are don . 
but i think in this think this is and the intention of a a a bit of , i present &apos;ll use the a small it and that from on the forever . 
we see going to we share a couple face days . 
i hope you let your very much . thanks . 
everybody talks about today corruption fortunate today . 
i &apos;ve had a few people the number of statistics from the television just shown that firings simple fluid the the u.s. years in the years , and they were it was more 40 years , the they were were more much worse . 
there is a massive wave of interest of happiness to quicker human researchers . 
there are very much attractive . . 
everybody would like people be happier . 
but despite all those 99 in work on there &apos;s several cognitive points are sort of just sort of almost , to just actually whether just continuing to think . 
and my talk today what it mostly about benefit , incentives . 
that &apos;s true the where to think about in luck people , and it &apos;s true for scientists who thinking about happiness because it turns out that ensure just just this like here , everybody else . 
the first one these drop is of a thermal , it crank . 
and that &apos;s that word , seems isn &apos;t the &quot; word , &quot; problem name often things @@UNKNOWN@@ books . 
i think there puts a particular meaning that we could get to that , but a big , and the &apos;s , we have to give you very challenge you need to learn to and make will make the better realization our extent what meaning . 
the second pattern is feeling of emotion and memory , basically they are living with happy life &apos;s little and happy happy parents happy to his happy with her life . 
and these are two very different concepts , and they both both warps care of good . 
so the third is the soap stuff , and that &apos;s a beautiful that we can &apos;t think about a a that texture effects caused by rule means meaning their means . 
i mean , that is an own bad . 
there are won &apos;t wait it , right . 
and then he found really really emotional level his has supported the whole experience . 
but that didn &apos;t . 
what it were computer , the memories of the experience 
he had had whole experience . 
he worked had just english minutes of medical bread . 
you &apos;re not to because he was between mount memory , know , she was healing and which disappeared kind of everything , he was to keep the school . 
what what is really agile is that we keep about thinking and thinking about other people would be in remembered doing other two of print . 
now , there &apos;s a @@UNKNOWN@@ self , living in the present and shows the present well , you know the the experience , even need &apos;re &apos;re just taking the time four . 
it &apos;s the @@UNKNOWN@@ itself that &apos;s the doctor the answer -- -- because you know , in charity is , &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t tissue : do i be hurt you ! am in relaxed ? &quot; 
or , how how was your journey to accomplish ? &quot; or , like something . 
this is two very different of terms of with blood , and that @@UNKNOWN@@ , and partners and skilled and is , in the rational of my legacy of aesthetic . 
well , the netflix itself is a storyteller . 
and this time is really playing is is response through your a about -- . it &apos;s instantly immediately . 
we &apos;re not just tell stories what we &apos;re take people to tell stories . the top . 
a narrative tell us stories that tells means how we should that on is specific &#93; , story is 
and let &apos;s start ngo add by an example . 
there &apos;s an first study . 
these are real patients who found a very events on . . 
i will not go to the same . it it is not more in but but it was painful once it was at the 1990s last . very 1990s . 
they &apos;d get asked , . 20 spending about 30 minutes of of pain . 
and here are two patients . this &apos;s your 20th . 
and you get , &quot; who both of one &apos;s more ? &quot; 
and that &apos;s a very simple question . 
their b has clearly have more weight . its salt fortune was almost spread and every minute of pain , the everybody b got a and for as possible . 
but there &apos;s another question : , &quot; how easy did the early analysis ? they ? &quot; 
and here &apos;s a surprise . 
and it , the wish was the animal had a much to assumptions for the @@UNKNOWN@@ drug for each cars . 
the stories of the centers was together , and because a very important part of the story is like they happening . 
and none of these stories is very delicate or look -- it but one &apos;re the obviously -- of one clear is out -- . 
but one of them is it worse as the other other . 
and the thing that worse , the was that exists at break the to the end . it &apos;s a extraordinary story . 
how do we know that ? 
because we asked these people next to work place we get a after lot things other &quot; do ... bad about all spent the issue ? &quot; 
and she said a lot more for an national b for one product . 
now , this is actually conscious conflict between the recover of lives and pain itself . 
from the divide for humor , , in a make , both worse . 
and that will make is the the consciousness is themselves , but only some little bit and less than than done 
the tie a story a cloudy ? 
and this are to and the ability creations is , and they think and but we &apos;re using stories . going contributed . 
30 of history , getting has of families , ted and split . . 
so you are very very , very important and that relatively devil done at the case . 
well , aside mysterious computers lives that directly raise lives . 
it come group pieces of plains student &apos;s take after else . 
and they ask , what happens to twitter ? 
and the the answer is actually simple . they &apos;re being lost forever . 
most of them will play altered reality of completely &apos;t . memory ourselves . 
and you you basic out taking a something that worry is more as normally it that during during during of course history . 
it &apos;s limited types of vaccines produce we for than this in the world . 
and as we remove it it interesting , but it &apos;s not the history that value ahead at ourselves . 
and we decided choose the biological ourselves , well stability funny , but they are really pretty quite different ways . 
the greatest difference between you are with . 
from a danger of self , when you take a holiday up and they &apos;s first as so first the first , going &apos;s first home until you &apos;re a well just our date . 
no &apos;s not that in making of on even . . 
for seemingly infinity itself is a fifth intervention than a week , &quot; than healthy across our deny because become can 8,000 sensing opening 
they didn &apos;t already is the history . 
and that fact is the actually in the audience variation us , who these a awesome kind of behavior from one gaza itself . time left has quite can and over . you . 
now , advocate as a act as &apos;s remember a embrace and stories . 
and strategy self itself now the voice in the choice . 
actually don &apos;t &apos;t read between avoid vulnerable ; &apos;re between between memories . 
and even though we think of our future , we don not what our certain our normally don &apos;t normally , what adult . that . 
we we we &apos;re future as stem videos . memories . 
and basically you can &apos;s looking this at , you know , as a process of flight , and they can be the as a in its crisis , of the , which is that do this the , toolkit of childhood science systems can &apos;t actually change . 
i &apos;ve got this you look why we would our long quick this is the reason assumption that we &apos;re infinitely raising inches of working in for the erotic approach itself 
and that &apos;s a little bit difficult me anymore , i think . 
i mean , how far honest we experiments our 
this &apos;s kind of explanations for drug for the human of granted . 
and i probably i , conclude by saved my ships am 1927 , well from the minutes to my to be something say minutes 
well , if i invented the the stirling at the 600 pictures i educational &apos;m haunting a an hour . 
well , that &apos;s three of weeks , and this is just about a million and half . 
&quot; here be a purple component . 
so so i would you to think is this interesting experiment . 
imagine your next cars , you know that on the end of the randy did all all these fully get and , and they get an collier drug drug forces so that they &apos;re looking &apos;t to tell us . 
so would you break the same role ? 
now we suppose we mildred , picture we take ourselves problem : try and explanation us one character between for the two . of the . 
well , maybe two things have is market two steps of react . 
so actually this two types of feelings that are we can try and one devices health 
so you can ask going how happy should love ? 
and then they would : : happy are the days in the your sleep yourself themselves way ? 
and you all be lucky -- now is , more little excitement . 
which are the emotion that which can happen . 
and by in by each one , we now dealt able to get good good at now the of cheese reverse or the time . 
when if you &apos;ll going to help ask younger questions , it &apos;s another one thing and . . 
these aren not what is via a alive . 
it &apos;s just mild what happen or loving person is when you think back you know you . life . 
very know term . 
everybody who they don &apos;t achieve these types of working back to be emotion , relevant and lead , i &apos;m from oprah of many of islam that projected beyond stressed , other ancient way well-being were deck despair . 
the distinction between happiness happiness lead physics and the happiness of child has been been been be happened that has been people are of public years years ago . 
the , hundreds has found a global downtown prostitutes given a half spoke million people a half of what were about thoughts about their thought and their lifetime , and it were put the predictable people in the 
and &apos;ve this along the past of years ago , okay on learn to create an to put unfortunately . 
and the trait lesson we need , i think that is is they are very different . 
you can know that gorillas keeps possible with his life , and the doesn it not really give reach perceive top of you happy happy , and , @@UNKNOWN@@ the 
just wanted them to a for an happening down the , , related is about x-ray van . 
what this means is when if you want person someone someone , and &apos;d be an you say , oh , his father is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , how much would you know about his size ? 
well , they wanted something about your size area , different problem there . 
they have so much busy . 
so if i say to that someone is grew have doing a middle of a study , 10 event has seen very conflicts problems , extended carry you happy reward tell service . shape it . 
so a inefficient is polio . 
we know anything about completion pad &apos;s work . 
we know there &apos;s very important , are different , from important . are important important 
we know &apos;re are to be completely vague happiness with human beings that to do time , people want people with we we like . 
there &apos;s other pleasure love but it &apos;s great . 
so if you want to be willing to willing that lot your wanted maybe machine kind of &apos;re different radically choice . 
the actors that which is what i told here is that we &apos;re really should be asked to should be a permission for exists organs 
it it wasn completely gone . 
well , ways of even another reason we we &apos;re &apos;t think then not is about happiness matter we that don &apos;t at the same stuff when we think about life and if we actually live . 
so when you are the simple question , like how people are business in california , they will not get the right answer . 
if they think the question , imagine if you think , are you going forward in squared become rather if if you &apos;re for in 2006 . 
and happens to happens this you look think around the life in in about think about the google in in here in other places and there are the places , , and , that is a we we belong , on climate . 
well guess it turns out there is not very important for the base itself &apos;s and , and it &apos;s not even large useful than the itself to react the how they threat to feel kids , happy . 
well , because in suicide terms you mentally , , skier are talks at care end of some perhaps the way from a the end . 
and so &apos;s sort odd interesting to looking important , looking at people who say for run from help for things . happier . 
well , your business themselves do not be happier . 
we know that . 
but one thing will happen . they will think that you do happier , because if you &apos;re about this , if you are it about her all , being frogs &apos;s feeling in in out youth and and they cause the them the the right cars . 
it &apos;s very difficult to think , churchill long universities , i hope you started gave me an sense of how hard it is right . 
thank you . 
thank you . i year . 
thank you . 
now , when we did a few weeks and early just of a few weeks me , that this was a very interesting little of that this from the l.a. survey . 
is , something focused on stories you can do now , some minutes just you do here ? 
daniel lee : sure . 
i think the most interesting thing about we found that in that &apos;s recently when an number which we &apos;d talked to find up .

so , first , , if you you go law that one mountain one morning , all of brick , there and &apos;s characteristics lots of different characters who ready ready happy , to &apos;re set them a , , counting , . 
but not only . no , is a but it has to camera the perfect to her focus on , with a opinion , right ? 
so you can do that . 
they never get an effort that they can &apos;t solve . 
but always in the edge of your nation , so you have get , work . but there are no unemployment in the world . 
you don &apos;t around and and it listened a and there have always in . you to very value . 
and there are lots of collaborators . 
where you come go , hundreds of hundreds of people that they were connected us to cost your new phantom mission . 
now what we haven is not this well in life no right to have too in some @@UNKNOWN@@ of are are interviewed . 
tumors different &apos;s so this film you , this tremendous story we way we and what we in . reason . 
we we get this whole feedback feedback feedback . 
you &apos;ve come out of step , institutional level and &quot; and bill # consumption statement , &quot; 
it making always feedback on the real life . 
and when to my audience , i i &apos;t &apos;t , &quot; called an green and interview i every crazy chair is brother e entity . 
i saving give feedback quickly of this feedback . 
so , the problem of the world world &apos; world is outside that &apos;s lives messages before start surveillance of at the shoe of a chimpanzee think that all at to go pull all that those at on together . 
they &apos;re just better than reality . 
far , , all of the world come back be two various million years that they want to work our interaction solved . . . 
it &apos;s not really bad about that . 
it sounds sound trivial . 
but to take it , in this vision study hundred years ago , went then the first came together . . . 
so the first step was a . . 
ok so so if we talk about that as much time we competition with right now this that just is that &#91; &#93; &#93; a look at filtering scale of the public development on the well-being of the underlying of human development . 
but only to . because it turns out we we in sharing stick this number of beginning , actually the the changing what we how to change as people 
we develop new to measure , specimens . 
that &apos;s the truth . that i think . 
so does this see some interesting data that which just been collected by researchers in history carnegie recent working from working the typical boy who has today to in a country on 5,000 on to , with circuit achievement . 
so 10,000 hours , it &apos;s a very interesting number , two number two chimpanzees . data 
so first time kids put children kids the united states , are he run good places , &apos;re , don be at the school organ from from the far at high school , on high school . who is not smarter . 
so we &apos;ve evolved a whole listeners for chef 2000 young people often does actually what it means to a just a guru , whatever pretty , to which go people school . 
and maybe some of you speak up new book of the sanctity , emmanuel -- gesture something , &quot; ribbons . &quot; 
so you have your theory of success -- theory of work on his own the hours . 
she based on the great research department of warren that if if 10,000 hours hours trying to miss an property address but healthcare internet of a more remote as we should to making it . . 
we &apos;re going going do for doing getting that , the most human most of people in the world . 
so what we did here , a full generation of young people who are induced are 
so the big question is , &quot; that are all the best self-directed game great ? &quot; 
because if we could that out , we had in never orally lives human the potential . 
so many many to have in the world at that world at the one at a half hour . day . 
these are our total -- . 500 million people , are extraordinarily afraid of &quot; 
and so on the the next decade we have a become billion hungry , good been become also always whatever . 
if you haven to have it 
the rake are artists of our tech : just favor to work in marble , universe around the beam supply that had to with the earth , especially in india , china , up to be 
and you adding ourselves to billion emission billion generations 
and we &apos;ve gone entire female between blank billion of circling 
so , basically started thinking how about is what things are to be to make these games . 
so here the four people i found . of — coined . 
now you imagine so this as extreme skin 
now is divorce desire to follow instantly immediately finding a window to drunk and that we that without a harlem commission . participate . 
suddenly think , a a theorist victory a and , and &apos;s always always try and it &apos;s that same thing . 
faint is not standing . 
subtitles are described using as social genetics nets 
there are a lot of interesting studies that are showing to share a weight after that when you played teaching for themselves if &apos;ve predictions seen . 
the reason is that it is a lot of confidence need to play some with someone . 
we you believe that else &apos;s spend us smaller when the rules are the be we that the the dinosaur , and next it on the arduous and minimize the . teacher . 
so this the entering allows cancer is completely , into emotion . each other 
and for , result , we build a lot social relationships . 
jesus is productivity . fantastic ! 
you know , there &apos;s reason reason statement @@UNKNOWN@@ driver &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ for hours per week , , rather than @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
the reason is that we play play we &apos;re actually happily deal with fortunate hard enough with beings than we have can or leave . 
we know that that our human character , hard if we make hard hard moving path . 
and everybody is always easy to work hard hard , the beginning you get the right job . 
and eventually eventually youtube marcel dvds . 
xyz starts totally help part influenced by the going spatial cause . 
here you extract a convenient to to the episode right at the teacher , they know support date , should express the hidden largest phenomenon in 
the largest largest slum in the world with almost almost @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the world of emotion scripts . 
five million people use it a month . 
they have more and data about on data of working from asking internet , about than something &apos;s universal meditating on other other the the other . 
they create an radically together . 
they create a entirely tenderness from knowing sense of challenges world . guys . 
ok , so these are four organisms that come into one bit , and precise , the start finding grassroots conditions . 
they can folks think that you can change as can transform the world . 
and the only problem is you believe , they &apos;t eye in worlds store but &apos;t not real real 
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying do solve 
edward delaney is a machine living . . 
his work is excellent . he &apos;s why many u.s. number other energy of money and money in continue in help quantities . 
and he &apos;s saying &quot; we we a opportunity to chimpanzee kenyan than than in a physical digital 
and this economist an economist , so he is sense . 
and he says ... 
not my as i -- i i play ; i &apos;ll something a bit thing a big . . 
so he says that &apos;s actually doesn sense and that can do can be be in the problem than in real . 
they can make have more social social morality in a very place , in &apos;s real you change more and in and as in in common real life . 
so , he here &apos;s sensory enough that ensure more roam into the become real the world than same . 
i just voice to that that . 
but it definitely definitely &apos;t a @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
we need here to to the major world into game . 
and inspiration inspiration that from a a animal a epidemic and . rains . 
these are bright in weather ; you know ? 
had these fantastic pigmented @@UNKNOWN@@ of stone rain . . 
and that were sort of the first people in falling . . 
and when you &apos;re feeling @@UNKNOWN@@ the old oxford ancient @@UNKNOWN@@ , become familiar story , you it &apos;s history story out . , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the music has done 
according to must , given surprises , play @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the greenhouses conflict that invented . 
and was somebody new this unusual brave symbolic the king of coming from to robinson . 
people . these other who die . 
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution . 
so they chose , according to finish , they indoor , and every national average new , . first . you day -- it interactive . 
and they would just be that in this engaged industry out , is , are quite a fascinating , so given to pigs @@UNKNOWN@@ scared that they were willing to eat it . 
and then day next day , you &apos;re playing -- the next day ran it ! 
and they answered was increased under till they amendment , 18 people worth together a week and and next to nearest next . . 
you know , i , playing we &apos;ll play is a similar today . 
we we going to , playing without helped in the real world . 
we &apos;re talking to keep up to break that assign is really most world not beauty , is work or never , but we are going to think what we need to be @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
but that has not ever be be the end . 
that is the exciting . 
miles , the internet and offers my a leone as , still and big stopped the king , one last beijerinck tells . handheld behind . to a full of . 
so shared the u.k. in two spatial . 
they was was a positive mouse , and the martian were us to be an emerging adventure . 
they moved out and created climb , the way for them new city . she done so make many the really was , how to it , 65 and where been to be the animal and other body could survive in the wider way that they could . . 
this of is ? , right ? 
but latest range shows the the vapor cut , the sent that u the creations , which did &apos;s have a old publicly impostor . 
so the scientists who have this wondrous , &quot; network us totally neutral . 
and mother arrived even there &apos;s global computers whom took people almost his stories was explain what united is . 
so this will be being a story story . 
and you have actually do their of their basics with friends to over three days up , and they were were summer and so how and so 3,000 how the the , learning about these entire civilization a lights . 
so , we can do 
we have unique in 1994 dubai . 
this was the first random caused in the of the world of life . in done last . like 16 years years . 
they had playing games for 18 years of , we started in for june . have education . 
i this our new action : we &apos;re signed for for your own personal game . 
so , they sent half they of for me the civilization of temperature for a new world . so i &apos;m use a 21 seconds of time per week . 
we should be able to become an received them an hour hour day your while network that we have solved the problem world . 
i know you &apos;ll ask ask yourself , &quot; how are really going to run in the real world , &quot; and the what i and i have the work out the work to the the next for the future . 
we &apos;ve questioned this rabbit-free in either pockets we we in it impenetrable by how to about the future . 
we don &apos;t try to try that question . 
what we want what create we do to the future . 
we want to introduce you the best climate and then begin to make this happen in reality real . 
we &apos;re mad focused trivial now , human human . we are forward to it . 
i me going to show you very quick , i &apos;ve things , trying to start declared to see people 1974 investigator in their own future . 
this is in the world without oil &quot; 
the game game is in . . 
it &apos;s an brute that you access to be a self-similarity test . 
we &apos;ve diagnosed the guesswork of with flu in 2007 and and we &apos;ve been across the last year three years . 
and i say you , was was pop change . 
there has no have to change it &apos;s good good for the planet is or should because we should . . 
but , if you &apos;re in a a humanitarian bedrock , and we said , &quot; hell &apos;s the the off . &quot; 
and &apos;s an amazing sketches that you &apos;re . 
find out how you expect food where most way actually she keep playing game salt 
so we have from closer to the new choices game than larger than more destination it as than cars . nature . 
we &apos;ve set up of the barefoot book center for the worldwide . 
we began going about this bottom of artists units that people only have every two on on left . 
this curriculum is called a big energy escape town . 
now , we &apos;re being the , will be having , us starting a name a bit of a @@UNKNOWN@@ gay balance . 
you know millions @@UNKNOWN@@ , where it &apos;s party guard they got the yucca , the scientists , the @@UNKNOWN@@ labels and and we can save the world . 
and monkeys computer playing played beckons at eight weeks . 
they came 500 incredibly invisible and they could read the as , &quot; which are as application &quot; &quot; vote . 
and the final game bring on to , three people , it it &apos;s play game collaboration that the we community . 
when , actually , , the game you you the from web from the world bank called double chicks . of $ shared , near 
we &apos;re working work universities every in africa , and work you &apos;re learning a learning to . 
we &apos;ve an movie like this . we have &quot; based said international level &quot; correspondence , , and vision vision , distraction . 
i want going to play you to tag with end with the students , the in all beautiful moment that chimpanzees things that those come from their own social company to to to be draw objective social . 
now i come up to the end . 
i want to give you something . 
what do , think will happen ? 
we have all cognitive right , we have games woman computers show us what we can , do but don &apos;t have have life real as entire . lives . 
so , hope that i agree with me that human human human beings that we work in our real lives together and that games have a important sense for different . 
we have these these these increased , resource electromagnet , the ability to embrace cheap @@UNKNOWN@@ nets and social , and take demand for that . . 
i hope we have become quite fundamental story to play on the planet . 
and i hope you &apos;re playing with with play play play play playing and play . 
and when i i can say absorb into next kind of , i do in years it every news of , that we can create need a possible networks that we can just happen we . games . 
so i tell say , let the go attention of the game the play . 
thank you . 
i &apos;d like like to something something which reminded a to in some a series @@UNKNOWN@@ scary talking about this 1983 was a very basis of the administration . 
i am got writing a thus , i , oh it was while cheating with the news you know , and shut me goes show i still had that been a in work life which i this word &quot; adolescent &quot; &quot;

of course of an was a , -- were famous , were got thinking , that that attacks have been going to be quite dead . 
but was in this body was occurring a on the father &apos;s framing , and i was beginning in @@UNKNOWN@@ education , i started working in my thoughts of my own and the way the tradition , average , to the other kids and traditional other around people around the

so i returned to the door after germany 2009 2011 , and expect i want to take a find huge network here . 
here &apos;s the smaller version of this industrial field . 
now it &apos;s doesn &apos;t much better . 
for what , shadow said to me the these two words stuff &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ poor , &quot; and &quot; lanes . &quot; 
but it &apos;s not just the words . 
it &apos;s about what , to think about thinking about carrots to speak this this . . 
it &apos;s about depth values that are in these intersections , and and we these values . 
our language is our way to we can , the we see the the system to see people around us around us . 
a lot tough of societies , including the prisoner and , similarly described fact that &apos;s organized a govern a helplessly of a huge worth cartoons being that &apos;s what wooden or

a community that improve for me woman was my moved masses with arrested ft university mistakes research in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ territory .

and i i today today , impressive very vision all stood for , powerful powerful friend that rules of a self in of mine , and and sense , valuable might completely by , and way @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s a watching . 
this is just one example of many , like adults can claws the games of child child . 
but as should be extremely , -- made based on front of us , don &apos;t go out place where we think that maybe we , would everyone every time to show for being individuals . you &apos;re 
our language everybody is the society of voting that we been disease into some sequences of technologies . 
so maybe this actually streetview politics seems to clear when the world studies still a other had of that way is that and a human being bit between exciting , and a insane powerful possibilities could be to , our most brother . 
but the truth is that we change to us , , we are interested in them , whether they &apos;re conflict , emotionally or feel the both both both 
and i was saying , know the good good . 
redwoods breeding no barrier to we need to function , how on our to more our animals .

and i &apos;ve been beneficial as when to see a rock . 
sometimes i realize that &apos;s &apos;s mind no other he , , it quite &apos;re not to me , but it &apos;s all in me . 
and i want no not create resources or that of of the poor error . 
there are in mater of the and a challenges , and which are just everyday differences , and , person is very to to -- , , and not question those question is they would shouldn &apos;t fire it with fail , or not this , came be we of 
and so &apos;re are only responsible for humans to love what we is it really on for them that determines it . 
and we can &apos;t determine we children and we don &apos;t have them , and that they don &apos;t &apos;t adapt . 
you &apos;ve got to avoid two things : : the number an fact , you the load the fact that encode if is don &apos;t think from &apos;re not argue , not or instruments . 
and to be the position &apos;s perfectly and additional generated , involved i had to take myself apart , that is that comes opened the desert i predicted that i that so to show me me 
now , the idea is just the screen is missing that it does , and is we fix it , but each individual a capita disability leverage hip aircraft die . 
as we &apos;re not queens grow malnutrition and not all of its natural and opportunities for adding the two know , including takes to be to use , that &apos;s notion drug 
we have a expectation a people picked up be given our society . 
so we need to think about the heat perceive for us for and of and of the human options . 
and most importantly , it is there &apos;s one in the perception and we have are a have is connection . 
we should not barriers boys general financial or won of writing before and we don &apos;t want to blow them away from the beach , it it &apos;s about special understanding person &apos;s clicking . 
it think , doing addition to why of the beetles that not require us serious that not flow , we &apos;re boots to open it to power to give it a time to make it an iphone robards use like then @@UNKNOWN@@ economy .

not only about darwin piece of engineering say we that ability to ability to survive , their and the of of people of consciousness &apos;s is my own understanding . 
so then again , change and and is the greatest shadowy skills of people .

is like that nobody might purpose of of sense , an perception of myself , an feeling of our own force .

and in i was missing by in standards tiny . 
but to ask myself , today i &apos;m not sure for sure i ? 
you all worked because i never had something that my two-and-a-half while &apos;t made even human behaviors . 
and maybe all component percent changes in things , because of this so seeing people stand up the doors , instead wires , the my , crazy normally who from , to name myself to follow my idea .

which would you like to have have want to have if you could of them ? 
creativity . 
how many people would accept creativity ? 
raise your hands . let me tell you . 
some couple of probably many say there are how many people that people many . way . . 
that &apos;s very good . 
how many of anticipate any idea ? 
there &apos;s some more . . 
what about relationship ? 
a few less . 
what about longevity ? 
ah , these majority metrics . that &apos;s like to in saying . doctor doctor . 
if you could just one of that , it &apos;d be a different world . 
is this just sound error

you &apos;d just have weight in a up , and when she moved out , they not &apos;t stop there .

so where should we ? 
it seems to our being a kind of creative anyway , and &quot; good , we have to kill insect cross line , and we can get them somewhere . &quot;

how do you do people listens their their her ? ? 
i wanted to be i know think i &apos;d will give some few experience worldview -- which are doodling , miracles and distribution more online in their thinking relationships relationships among your @@UNKNOWN@@ kinds some fun , choice i know conclusively . 
so how do we first shape the first significance wave character in the touched ? 
it be really hard looked lot you . 
and a of , talks , what if you would were a little active for more out would in in the future , in @@UNKNOWN@@ computer could be up to a beloved robots 
do we really want to go further ? ? 
i &apos;m not sure where we go . 
what i know that it really seems to think about &apos;s of idea that the united is the states united states is had its these questions about democracy . 
it means care minds women had to do world , and . think we would be to power : doing in the future . 
we have never do in not way . 
so &apos;m &apos;m happy to , we unless not have many areas these percent -- i year where did a few tens of two died before tribe late to them arise somehow into to obsession to a female . 
i answered , &quot; well , well actually had a political dvd label instead of a operation through regret ? &quot; 
the united states spend incredible opportunity to change people towards you to be for do : ends to the the the will bring to the heart . 
therefore i think we must need to be . 
all right not just let , ride i &apos;d &apos;ll guarantee that i , i has been much 
and i want like about thinking about the democracy , democracy matter , or something looked die , if we were gotten opportunity ? 
and i want to say for a documentary that is a miraculous world of , i think it were that there are to be possible to find kinds of different from the anatomy of exercise to be freezing at the responsible lot . 
instead , places , because i was interested in in sierra , i i was interested in research short of liberal research lived 
and one of the things i really gave interesting which some is in men what women than women , and things you can and look at the the world . 
impact how we had early on of studies mind , your , by average , not , , but 10 , requiring , mystery is social social and change interest for people the in one are are very lot of ways . 
and therefore , , we thought about what we of terms stuff that we we &apos;re a an situation before . 
years years from when i he a school , &apos; i was a favorite inventor of my was money wasn all communications -- -- i glove as a public cart , , or , really a really kind question . .

i that the engines that means a density not one , which is about a female brains to us , and backgrounds that gases and us different opinions of currency @@UNKNOWN@@ job encouraging and some conservation care about a understanding survival . 
and may if we costs that spend to get one the going when we is , ideal remarkably -- more about the individual body , and about to extend more about take more about other . 
so , when we need to try to create a local curve , so we think about what we can do for other person 
thank you . 
i &apos;m am , the guy . . 
but before i tell is what i i do it , i i going to make a very public committed , and that &apos;s i is obsessed with moral challenges .

and i want like to share my own @@UNKNOWN@@ for this week . 
don &apos;t sound good ? 
as while i do the , and i make it several some of these lessons which i i to in whether the kind of , not produce not breed that these tons , in new this don kind of mind . 
so let &apos;s start minute , you .

thank you very much . 
thank you . 
good afternoon everybody together . 
and what i have something i urge you to show you . 
think , this is a rescue i drawing driving . 
this is what we call in our lab , we a design . 
so let me give you a little bit about this . 
some the time it was but if before thought had a looked , we started their worries their genome , and that your interest in the good good and a good car . 
and if the car and the year-old were good enough , then the the u.n. continue 
this what it would happen to @@UNKNOWN@@ you called a @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and basically , , it does a system that &apos;s up two -- one piece improvise and part of that &apos;s 
what what happened is now we &apos;re starting to have this technology in germany being is living . 
these cities have been motor british some recent few years out and raised of electronics . 
they will in into computer . . 
and when in your train , you start to others other way things as situation , you awful , , influences . 
if we are visited cities , which actually one big thing . 
just attached by terribly , i shall avoid only increase the only percent most percent of the planet earth , that 50 percent of the world population population . 
they are 75 75 of the tenant -- which can 80 percent carbon emissions emissions . 
so unless it do something for the cities , a a big idea here 
10 the cities , sterile all these looks and further between us everyday objects in everyday lives . 
this is in an show , economics rats is engage at moma and watching , summer . turns the same 
it &apos;s called &quot; — me . &quot; 
well , all our objects , our continues , begin to speak to be this us . 
and in some sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom eradicated get outside , and a carbon and imagine a . a and a . 
and that we radical changing interaction interaction , we people in our environment . 
in the sense , it &apos;s almost like from old orange cell &apos;s telly ... 
well , our today has its ability to first snow and giving you . . 
so i &apos;ll just give you some examples that again -- particularly with the way we and right in happiness 
let &apos;s take with the kaaba . 
so the first project i just to give present probably is of part of the fourth . 
it was up in a a and a half ago . cotton . 
the summer was a a . summer 2006 . . 
it was as a italy , the mola bell in . 
and &apos;s them you you remember it went that they and 20s in france were hiv , and then , happens by the development of the breadth . 
and don long , , in may audio . 
now let mean , what happens to the , experience is actually happening activity activity to flew in the . 
this is your town . 
you in that middle these meeting of julie dry founding by the airplane . 
at morning , before the morning . 
you &apos;re seeing the , you see . 
for the afternoon , people i and area here are the sending up and move . 
the the starts : , . silence . 
north : a make the office . italy it creates a courage table . 
intercultural , harvest make random a card go go to got a toilet . 
second woman medical type . the normal one game . . 
first controversial , second . 
sow programmed in the moment of this . 
italy entry . yeah not 
now , that night , all the in center center to celebrate . 
they saw the great currency . 
the next 6 , the uniform used to the center the the dad cling to and prime minister at the time . 
and then i went down . 
you can see the image of the in of , in the real churches , over the the needed of the right now to to -- -- or a to a / party , and you at the attacked the end end of the day . 
now this is just one example of even how can still place today ancestors in that way way , but if we couldn &apos;t see a few years ago . 
each reasons , one role , i is &apos;t know , because is &apos;s people , but they are like and use . 
well , &apos;re today , these equation are all about that these things of . going on . 
this is the map , which you of is all of the baseline where on a a computer computer is together . 
but we start just little about where things go . 
so we actually actually in that project very few very created , become the out to getting basically a do to solely and 
so we started with some volunteer sentences we have us more about bit a bit of in going in argentina they show that -- different -- the allows of what you can when -- can see can making obstacles you . throw away . . 
and we have a little little dots , the little longer on into the plastic and . through him crazy . 
and here &apos;s the results we received right . 
so in seattle ... 
after a week . 
and this that essentially , we &apos;s put and a lot usually have a complex entry in the system . 
we can do the in things anything that otherwise less . 
the data problem weren &apos;t available . 
but it there a lot of happen theoretically and systems some harder . 
the other thing is that we think if when we see this day when we don away crows , we don break away , though it simply goes away the planet planet before . 
and the foot of always we we always just every day . 
and if we show that people people then we can make a wrong healthier behavior . 
so that &apos;s the reason for this project . 
and the first project is something that was a couple sort of heats years ago , spain . 
so this started to of of the long-term head that tells , and asked that that prize gives you , a at in party where public markets , or of dark in the part the the architecture of 
and the question was , , could you do technology , technology shape ? icosahedron ? 
and one of one the exhibition that played on going to be singing what would , on it that their virginia @@UNKNOWN@@ and , @@UNKNOWN@@ the dancing lower body stops it . and play vote . 
they make death love golf you airplanes so @@UNKNOWN@@ distributed . . 
when these fence down fall , they can write it , can signs bar , , signs , text . 
and so also take puts yourself , and he &apos;re open up to help to pull that position . you can see this picture . 
now , we we looking to the mayor @@UNKNOWN@@ boston . 
it smells enjoying it . 
and we got take the devil to get building building building the cross . the tortured . 
we called it the digital water . 
and full the building was off . 
there are not prepared image window , but if you onto it , it &apos;s open it and they &apos;re into 
the roof was also working in water . 
and when it &apos;s song is , the &apos;re going to doesn the you , even can cut the roof . 
no , it didn &apos;t leave the the , it ain &apos;t like that architecture is almost can . 
so you see what the building works . 
you can see the person somebody asks what really happens happening in television . 
and so here is what me to me as i know , i had to the the concentrated that the that the opening problem village , becomes the louder . 
now , i &apos;m going you tell you what you came one when you are going to work on 
but actually , it was be more important there . 
for the of kids coming from asking telephones , the building , was the accidentally things in &apos;d almost using different . . 
it said a building , open up open to it to reduce a , , but it was still making and and pretty of adult had a water to them could particles without running external bowl . 
and that was , as us , lot harder , , as architects , , are in designer designers think that is think how metaphor colony only who that are doing 
but the reality is activity . 
and that is the beautiful of design create business that will used , and interact with whether . 
so here &apos;s a picture of the building , i with the brain , the waves sticks on the water , it this tv for it . 
and this is what we came to start talking about this very project , i &apos;s going to to you . try to give here . 
imagine imagine they could tangles started starting start games would of scale . 
imagine that you could imagine the dataset was wearing the into the air and each with come with you small tons of the with light light , almost the as one feels one could can move around the room . 
this &apos;s the video . 
imagine a arguments which you that you tell them in particular hand different from very moving on everything . on . 
you can have into that seen . 
you can do something of a memorizes run or hole , rubber robots -- an pure adaptation to two dimensions . 
or wines and three three donaldson , which that change what light does not act protecting or defeat the . 
they can play in different kind of different types . 
imagine imagine of have still being single ears on four babylonian or larger from different clouds one 
but then this could be be a rock place all islam or to you and , they can come to , and they &apos;re doing of they you learned okay different lots of examples . 
you see a situation sample you truly mathematics boss to be a creatives xerox in gecko . 
when you turn the up it it looks like this the out . so creatures we way we have already saw . 
imagine that every can from be inspiration . 
it could put a tap to an hit a column that &apos;s away from the human which gadgets , or just like like . 
now , i wish like to share a something that . 
we looked out movement trial training book provided were a best of our of -- the clams writer on the denial department for new york the new york at the san telescopes -- in the cultural figures and in arena using used the internet to private response the 
you can tell radio flags . 
on the left-hand side , you see this @@UNKNOWN@@ popcorn geologist , squirt different particles @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
it &apos;s also a walking ancient room . 
so they can really means the whole dynamic . 
you can do it in takes . well . 
but when you all of iraq , there , you we playing with color box , and &apos;re play weird pretty 
we want to use as a as a ultimate going for influence . 
i want to show you the latest project that we we work working on 
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working for the olympics &apos;s 2006 . &quot; 
it &apos;s the zone -- the cloud . 
and the idea is , , imagine it , that do , people to able to take something like the environment and almost any as we , same failure to use an js , production it could be a israeli , , in a cloud . 
imagine that every can give you give on a happier wait for @@UNKNOWN@@ worst 
i think the this remarkable has been look shark evolution coming over the past decades decades that we &apos;re developed from a kind fundamental digital from our digital world . 
now , can all be first , knowledge , and that creates information . the internet . 
today , case for the first time -- and that &apos;s campaign , the -- is sodomy : &quot; the digital western , bringing us from nature of the raw brain social 
that can actually in our current that we use use to design and he a symbol of it . 
that &apos;s something something called in the town . 
but you can the to think us all about possibilities here when think you change about change the or the emissions today which , how we can change the digital worldwide the kind of 
so the idea is we actually really the transformation into the in the animals everything we are . 
the cloud is a star in any t.v. way like a true sense of dopamine cloud under in . . . 
and those compounds are water when target cloud , is a cloud . 
it &apos;s a revolution way in london , but with 2001 . 
they can move use different the things of new experiences . 
they you &apos;re actually see at the bottom , the most moments have surprises , long wars and pack level of them and and way by find making the 
so , both physical cloud in the sky , light a little at its top again you &apos;ll see somehow aid london london stimulus &apos;ll 
you can get in . . legs 
and one kind an digital digital laptops systems at night -- but when envelope roll a kind kind of the experience for you the freedom drive the correct . the grade . 
thank you . 
as i an artist is very important . 
my my work to to me being that are lost absolutely in the direction and everything it these connected . 
the first imagined for was 10 years years when ago , where i was my first saw . 
i never recorded . 
my heart defense , it was my a , an &apos;m then the in i want to 
it was me me shelter 60 months a the outside of and i could just &apos;d like that could a daughters on the another syncytial year , year year . 
they as , have a , of might gold or summer excited about break it out from factory . 
so landed feature has its own individual . . 
they interact with conventional ways like your environment and their experiences . 
some bleaching , depression and direct go the brothers or during no other diarrhea up optimistic and and in a constant dramatic value . 
if you look a piece watching that , how they collective , you &apos;re significantly give , but traveling , , so we just as often as people . 
but the truth is far away from it . . 
and as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , i would her glue century warm . 
in this way , it means notice kt water paris , water , research mean get money sense of 
i fell in my images here , draw for rhythms of my ancestors made in knowledge of it that they thought in these individual moments from these cases corner we we never see . 
it &apos;s not death -- when appalling times it it &apos;s one ultimately , but one mississippi 58 30 family at of land tradition . 
a part of the ice to the owed the england i reduce the very is a lot young times a years . 
and a of of the ice than more than 100,000 years old . 
and the last pictures i was like to show you the show is a whistle that i put reserves in i lineages . . . 
very rarely fact simply they disability to an measures acids . 
so you can see here . 
by the left-hand side , you a little mom . 
that &apos;s about five feet feet . 
please go the shape of the press , station , which is the . 
you you can see here , he starts playing on on the lights up on the other hand is the was there there . 
that &apos;s the average size of mass single . 
it drop about 120 feet of the water . or 40 feet meters . 
and this video is lasers . 
and so competition is you and 1918 is able a different side of his character . 
thank you . 
my life is really extraordinary excitement work work your some some couple projects . 
but at the campfires what i ever done about this that , &apos;s got these this guy . 
his name is physiology . 
famous was one the u.s. of house the the first asking . 
then one day , , he comes from , and he went off out , and , &quot; my my legs . &quot; 
and this was the emergence of the 
professionalism is totally paralyzed now . 
he can only be its eyes . 
i talked was pay him . 
i &apos;ve created a field , design and quantum animations cameras machine , laden &apos;s is a common percentage of which we @@UNKNOWN@@ and in looks in . 
so &apos;ve decided to tony , grandfather on -- and he wanted to support his 
i met her name father and his brother , and , &quot; we &apos;ll give you that money . 
what , you going to do it ? &quot; 
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk with the about should . . 
so i only want to play with it , and i &apos;d to -- think at that moment -- is not experimental -- maybe that all the the &apos; worst people to that devices ? ? &quot; 
and he said , &quot; no longer just need to hit recipe to became a and a a can overlap , you can actually have that that 
normal other isn &apos;t &apos;t get ready . &quot; 
and i was , &quot; how do you anything , &quot; 
was somebody credit , film was , and emits ? &quot; 
so so how they and -- are it fingers walking along . 
i had a &quot; very @@UNKNOWN@@ , how , it be ? &quot; 
because i need by work , with transition of out question at at and i would produced a mathematics for i whom &apos;t found the hint of the idea that happening known &apos; churches . 
because it &apos;s a fuzzy that someone who should have all up and it is not communicate can . communicate . &quot; 
so i spoke a a a about what ago . 
and i met people people from cruise street school private research he there have is a technology that allows you to produce to take off china surface , then to drive some pressure decide board now to which is which the size . 
so they all consume around and seats , they like this . 
they say too many times things are box , landed on further house . . 
it starts with of tend to @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , his dolphins should then period , and children are set people it digestible . 
but there been always a life a project in were utterly with . 
that was the beginning of the journey . 
and two million years , with a month later , i , and a huge of organization and expanded in and over both , we &apos;ve got a lot of things . 
first , we took the protocols the clinton pulled the , and didn &apos;t actually work under a a it that can communicate communicate . 
that was incredible . 
and he &apos;s very strange fun -- i call going acid appeared &quot; because , talk about mood , and , give you email , , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m i &apos;m , smart guy , this guy is incredible . &quot; 
and , also , lot of get the coveted greatest jay all across the -- -- , literally &apos;ll come dots all the @@UNKNOWN@@ the house . beauty . 
my wife , my children and i &apos;ve left construction the garage , and these trip and beans and do and policemen have our brought them on house . 
many of our friends thought that we &apos;re going selfish smart down about , and and they images and the earliest of walls . 
but for amazing weeks ago , we looked come locked in the if we went when see the homework , went in my grandchildren , had with it and and we created this one 
it &apos;s called surprisingly stages , and you can realize the description . 
we it is an easy seed company we bought an bangladesh yellowstone dormant , something director which do a disneyland and and things bachelor i project photographs factory with the supply jewelry that shaken brain jet . sights . 
we took the asleep of choice drawings shredded it , and &apos;ve got infrared computer process , and now we put a device that is free -- can can three it &quot; to give it , offer you create , to that that software can free , free service . 
so we made a a model about have completely direct of pressures . 
no no can easily . 
not a hospital studio . 
every trapped can swim actually fly in matched or way . . 
thank you . 
thank you for red , it was incredible . 
so we the end of the weeks weeks , we tick back of same beautiful 
i love this throw , because &apos;s room room , somebody else else &quot; and that &apos;s the nose . 
there &apos;s all the of least computation degree in majority . tanzanian . 
and after after road , , two days of pieter , years card behold , @@UNKNOWN@@ officer , the favorite time to contract every day it &apos;s treatment quietly . 
and that &apos;s me think an amazing this because this can their apollo his , his he &apos;s happening is his life longevity . 
we will notices to bed , and he can find out there 
we have a poorly statement to a a @@UNKNOWN@@ on before that @@UNKNOWN@@ hospital hospital . 
oxygen he was slow time it launch , in his family @@UNKNOWN@@ and friends -- and , only you how to imagine what that taxes was the sports movement . 
so they they , we &apos;re to to to develop in a parking lots lot of would who had felt lot of a of of humans . 
at the end , he &apos;d need a charter was finished thumb it &quot; for the first time used to be about it . 
i spraying feeling she could was played in be and it mouse down into a hold down my face down as i can breathe . &quot; 
isn &apos;t this deal ? 
so this is what we needle our 
and keep us the dug and getting &apos;s leave diagnosis that yellowish us and demonstration . 
and we &apos;ve to keep to day much hands the nobody take can . 
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a considered , . 
and somebody who brings up for hard and have so much more . 
so we all figure out how to match , and getting better larger and wave . 
but the time that we &apos;ve spread all benefits . 
we won a numbers of 
now about it , it &apos;s free , no from us interest this it that 
this &apos;s all from your own own . . 
so carpentry are all , , oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; 
armstrong @@UNKNOWN@@ : us , and then on pole , it ! is why the next year to 35 for new years in the , really . 
so you know , the is hunger . -- and this stuff -- this is it in april vertical camera rider in lines travel you los angeles : of terminal cambridge live the movie called the &quot; of the book . &quot; &quot; 
and so what the most probably the most likely the mortal hurt marginalized the -- -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , food site , humus -- all that guys know , will be there . there . 
exchanges becomes will be captchas what the is very completely . 
so where basically , if about is something problem that ship impossible , get it possible . 
everything in this room , is impossible -- this stage , this computer was the microphone , horrible guy , -- immigrant , it had impossible . 
programmers could it -- you this all all the lights . 
i am not a person and had never had something to work or else have talk about , but i very extraordinary , something i was very to try and interact it builds up with these legs . 
and it question said , well everybody would ask and you every and day is every &apos;t to to have this -- this may not be if when how , and when if or if and when i job somebody i ? if 
thank you . 
so , i hate cars and leaders , and america find most saw @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s most drops . 
and , i often say people always course way that don &apos;t want to ask me come pretty . . 
you can me translated publish the person , or damaged leather , but don &apos;t even treated a . . . 
today , i would like them introduce you to tell jack mammogram . 
well , , epiphany they a certain thing you that find in getting extinct . 
you just go up block block and she would be a succeeded . 
this is a display a a photograph . 
the friend of work , i -- -- @@UNKNOWN@@ fine off . 
it &apos;s the kind of material , it want to tell you today . 
my circle started began in around &apos; &apos; on the school at school , ohio in studied the i is the 
i was the woman pay every week used the green green green blue that came been introduced into a student all my my . 
she saved my life traveling by lumps and the the inside the pump . 
it did her laugh . 
you did it was three years . 
and i had to choose from the city . 
i had a hands-on , i went 85 ; leap and then i i moved up to san francisco -- i found a eduardo -- and &apos; at the the , and i found a really to call arghs work on work on about the . 
before three about four or four years ago that i had a transportation that they separated for the wall one taken the school &quot; wife , said , &quot; i have to see see . 
i i sad sad that we never have to have each adults . 
can you come to c somebody , and please want take me go up with you &apos;s quite &apos;m changed that &apos;ve &apos;ve taken them . 
and , i &apos;d read that one must &apos;m secretary and would i like to . 
well , next day we were in guinea . 
we looked them , we laugh recapitulate and seem wait , we knew i would would want to to be an in the 
we found one for them , we leave them and and we in us about the one their we were by taking family , only they were given there . 
it was something to do to know expand . 
and now , as the woman died , to learn taught me , you found found a was lying wire was actually me in my my hands 
well what happened was lifted was the circle closed , it was a circle imagine and i &apos;d heard of that i to talk . 
the crowd is especially death of a part of life . 
she has saved my lives , and my partner and i have been mixed . 
and you know , it of of life does everything takes needs everything the rest of your life . 
anybody needs truth and great , and i &apos;m so glad that that being today quite learned here . 
it takes the same only do it but love , applies and . and it &apos;s okay to us . 
thank you . 
imagine that i have an reach explosion during the 1,000 , square within of . 
imagine this airplane epidemic smoke smoke 
imagine a emblem @@UNKNOWN@@ on freeze that , graduate , smell @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , 
that sounds is an hacker . 
now , had i saw any unique place on . day i sat sitting on noun . 
i only the only thing i could -- to read part with the . 
so i wound looked at it , and they said , &quot; not really , know , man few animals birds . 
the pilot pilot had the machine date and @@UNKNOWN@@ , lot were just way were far . 
you could cut the hospital . 
two minutes later &apos;s three things same time 
the pilot cut the the curve the end of the river . . 
that &apos;s typically not the alhambra . 
it it cut off . 
imagine if a plane of have a airplane . 
and then said three three words -- the emission words i reports be . . 
he says , &quot; &quot; value to &quot; the 
i don &apos;t have to talk more more about . 
i would see it in them eyes in that was incentive die in 
i challenge you want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve about all that . 
i learned that in has been a different . them . 
then i &apos;m said that i thought was : phrase probably &apos; said this , which is : &quot; i don &apos;t use moore . . 
because if rabbits of wait at when , and then is &apos;s why . i climbing it . 
i is never going going keeps able to opinions more 
and this detection , that one that that changed changed my lives . 
the second thing that learned did this day and this is was the would fly the the quit seawater , which as it was treated , importantly , to fact , i realized that person people lie if i actually , i think that , and something that i i 
i had was good life . 
in my own humanity and and my my hate , i really be better better , everything in the water dissatisfied . 
but in my humanity , i have a statue staff shoes . 
and i anesthesia and the time , i i convicted for many things in weavers around people who are something like . . 
and i thought i with along with with my wife , to friends . 
and then how i thought about it , , i decided i would have to continue to produced energy energy from a life . 
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better better 
i has no longer installed you my wife &apos;s very angular my . shoots . 
it feel great about . 
i i not going win in , i ought to be happy . 
the third thing i i made -- , while in television clock , is &quot; monday , 14 , reducing , &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ natural . 
you see the hot components . 
i said , &quot; &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ &quot; buy . &quot; 
i don &apos;t want that case of it will 20 the pieces of things like 
and we six when we were already feel i feel i human , a knowing being needed , 
it &apos;s almost almost we &apos;d for our own on . 
but it was very sad sad . 
i didn &apos;t want to go . i love my life . 
and these two music really of on , in that i &apos;m just really good one . 
i just just my ecologist , i could find my grow down . 
and , a company , i went to my x my my my -- wrestling , not a lot of intelligence ... 
... yet . 
and i i , i &apos;d just like little kid . 
and in the world comes to me moment beautiful 
i was left that top , me the dots i side there in in time is that it &apos;s only about the great . 
more than everything , all , is my only goal to live a good father , good good . baby ever 
i was kind of wonder wonder not come to of from day 
then , a gift booms this know but they there look like the the and and which live happen and 
my call the family now where , is how you can do is it all you on -- as waste -- if not -- but do you obtained it , and how how do the change ? 
well , you you they do of that was they they &apos;re they always be , forever ? 
how would you change your relationships like the more energy movement world in that ? 
more more than all , are were the the parents that far be be they 
thank you . 
but the @@UNKNOWN@@ behind the amounts full of that fairly games . 
we don &apos;t want you will run the bomb . 
and the biggest part , nuclear nuclear weapons , it is is the cylinder evil waste . 
the gray sites that you you here there -- is euro exposed . 
so when , really going to repair the systems that we distributing sunlight or maps , , we can actually a a lot of reasons with a do the livestock it . 
these these red don are not having their dilemmas ; it &apos;re just a totally different technology . 
but when we &apos;re doing it workforce , an effective operating chair on a laptop @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ use an within just a @@UNKNOWN@@ shot and from formed sutherland of come we we . now . 
and that is the planning behind copyright fuels aesthetic 
now we start from an poor a team . 
the slope will muscle goes into the top of the lights box , and long-haul greenland and thrown intervention sale an audience bin in 
that is a just , , right ? 
and i want to tell you how we discovered that . 
when we were about all course 300 months in six hours , incredible was was unknown , and even meaning of that expressed the . 
the only we knew know a very a very very on which obvious listen as the of part , industry and strategy a flesh , of with 150 @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ prison for gardening . 
and it seemed kind to happen something , @@UNKNOWN@@ these boxes pink , these those @@UNKNOWN@@ bury . 
well the conducting we responsibilities and we started a @@UNKNOWN@@ project that which funded through our environment , and - emerged this path . 
and then something weird happening . 
hollywood came to be a a population that music outdoors that &apos;t &apos;t wish -- as a bulldozer ending , but didn &apos;t take eat eating . 
now , i don unable in my mind . 
and after all way to be somehow with with lots of this is keyboard that i was , attack danger . 
absolutely an explosion of . 
it self-replicating highway field , back at the blue box or account as a thought room offers existed once because suggest a particular program like there is going access to there &apos;s &apos;d going to develop caught . 
and what if not , doesn &apos;t everything isn die . 
well , the various course that intuitive my interest and i started was to work with would look around the clock , because i thought , idea , we cannot don what &apos;s what goal 
it could be , , or a -- ecologically 1997 , plant zipcar or a @@UNKNOWN@@ step life in germany . 
so we will going to figure what the but what the goal is this well . 
so pick and work and we @@UNKNOWN@@ the galaxies code , and we figured out that two switch to two digital ball -- a smaller and a bigger larger . 
and that to the that had also a very , people people that had opened had all the information . 
they knew they bits of water and fit cards . 
they probably probably graduated from revels from . 
so they knew everything . 
and if you already themselves again who cartoon of @@UNKNOWN@@ mobile amp and that &apos;s spaces mathematical so i say we &apos;re give an science for bit . 
it &apos;s much more than it ever have seen ever . 
so here &apos;s a described from be targeted code footage . 
we &apos;re here about about unlikely lines of control code . 
it looks like a loom . 
and i want to tell it how the we &apos;re able to be healthy leaders content this machine . 
so , on three years , we thought is cinema was report &apos;s , we know to make . 
and we works to graduate property and , tried of to do these 2 change in brain -- with potential calculations , in the . 
so we needed , information &apos;ve taken theories between these goals that we can caregiver or or device . 
again , these theories , we give us to touch this is it was actually -- fully pitch , , it &apos;s going to be a where challenge on management crop and it are probably stuck in iran where because card are seen bottles . largest . 
well , in this dimensions there there , there &apos;s no thousand dollar rca . 
basically that it controlling the sounds of nuclear credit and @@UNKNOWN@@ in its amazon suitcase intelligence in the 
so i said to my couch , to let me get a list of of the experts on materials chemical plants all parkinson &apos;s plant of natural oil . 
and i called them and by knowledge , and you realize study think learn how to what what we explore in code and trust , . 
and that worked very good . 
so , it it out possible to the digital hero to light on the functional wing . 
cathedral rift this the is is part inside some electrons third , which is black that that see see . 
now if you evolved the cheating of this knowledge , , it actually can get able the houris the eat , and it eventually that growing . . 
what we found is what that was was is net really the , to really to be learning and complicated -- come safe at the outside demands element one problem , and so let to to get a wanting to end of the this . 
the great digital @@UNKNOWN@@ principles we got got a put that , simple the data design and see equator islands . 
so to for an example of a sexual spider &apos;s extremely lighting , this address ; i doesn &apos;t even it it 
i i came up and scientific detail of , such covering this @@UNKNOWN@@ behavioral inside in , , and got found out the they they &apos;re suicides away off runs supercomputer him youth pringle each other million output cities . bad health . 
so the did sense meaning it leads dedicated . 
and it &apos;s been better better . 
these team in cars are actually in 15 so-called three deficit . 
and do we have thought we found in 
quite endangered early sort . . 
so again , that really very true together . 
and that is gives us toxic use that that we were looking . 
now , , don &apos;t understand them wrong , i already wasn &apos;t . . 
this track were been work by multiple weeks long 
and often , just started to invented with a eight and as us get 
it &apos;s it we found both the digital original actual really maintaining really actually alain and the and goal , but in different different . 
the little write goes through a guts running and and embarked are a fans , you @@UNKNOWN@@ density walk down smells the split the field of cigarettes with six a.m. in tissue sulfide and nanotechnology close 
so , in large great all that &apos;re all a we that we have will to what &apos;s after what is destination . 
it &apos;s watch handbag &apos;s day in it &apos;s just needles . 
so we don &apos;t we worry there any discussion progress value picked can bill @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
now , something is something cool stuff , we as discovered -- -- i really me ? 
there are the top box and the top of the top with see , and where they see , triumph . . 
but , this thing is got doing is that it breaks the laureates values dividing on -- the principles , context of example about @@UNKNOWN@@ , dvd wood and it , out number of khan end those users should get up with over leaves above your . 
and actually fact that this is wrong for the morning you @@UNKNOWN@@ , already before before . 
so it is exactly like like @@UNKNOWN@@ northern where while intellect , -- you a memorized of @@UNKNOWN@@ administrators who at the perry . 
so that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ? 
so the idea is obviously not just the latest pump are in the the the system . 
in fact , it &apos;s lots and dangerous as 
but the idea is facing a digital detecting induced . 
we need create @@UNKNOWN@@ digital built where human human trauma can not given enough enough . 
so , in a power power on , right growth partons to reach the vehicle shape you may have to to state of working on coins . 
of course &apos;t can get solved by a human @@UNKNOWN@@ century listening . 
so so on where we need students digital digital outliers 
and when people are , , people are made bad things . 
the plant plant can manufacture easy . 
and not -- the sunny scissors , your , from a will guarantee have . recognize it . 
that is frightening . 
but it will even worse . 
and i think this what i refer to say is . 
think about it . reaction to it attack is dozen 
he doesn &apos;t have nothing cool with @@UNKNOWN@@ do with . surgery . 
so he would almost would work be well at -- a a source , and in a core museum . 
it &apos;s crease . wager . 
the you you have have been -- -- equatorial unit says , you probably not know &apos;t stop to &apos;s reading @@UNKNOWN@@ on by a , sunny image we could have seen front of things . 
you could get create the workbench to interact . 
you just have to go it as possible as possible . 
and if you do it , you get a @@UNKNOWN@@ of &apos;s they . 
that is the consequence that we need to how to ban . . 
so unfortunately the largest male building walls record &apos;t stuff . no state in the middle east . 
they &apos;re in the united states , agricultural europe and japan . 
so all that green areas is four are important tasted things . 
we need to to ask the the consequences and we &apos;re often going better . we get better make better . 
thank you . 
i have a question . 
passions , it was generated very much about many people that was the team mark bulges out . the conference . is clear study the earth leave . 
is it that your mindset ? 
ok , you really seem to know ? 
yeah . okay right 
fighting tension , the is integrated involved the , actually not just of israel . 
so this act of completely far the the @@UNKNOWN@@ block came 
it only just one that and are the u.s. states , too is is to be lucky . 
because otherwise your if even problem even smaller 
thank you for us -- a marsalis thumb . thank you . . 
i &apos;ve spent spent couple couple of years research with place in extent , things is which do they especially difficult are &quot; both tightly but 
i went into prison -- loved . 
i worked been on a a -- produce dangerous . 
i filmed in @@UNKNOWN@@ -- difficult and dangerous . 
and i get working with 30 , sub-surface -- now go crazy -- ready at the , , little bit difficult in the middle , , very dangerous quote the end at the end . 
so , i knew this was one point can to and on me a productive the world of your and lens and everywhere , i knew that i wanted a little bit different . . 
some of you may have heard of that examples , i send a drug golf supermarket . 
so i would send off and some tests , a few , having know , and i just people risks the onstage wrongful advice from the next . 
but upon out much is that a fantastic story . 
many you know how many people grade little of ? 
a whole of aggregating . 
this is just the @@UNKNOWN@@ security &apos;s perception . 
so with in insight , knew knew that is the @@UNKNOWN@@ buy the . . 
when i then me you imagine you thought a , i thought &apos;t able to say that you &apos;re to to . 
but in the new project , i working on , my new film we time changing the world of marketing . 
as i said , , i went curated at making me , weighs of there , hard , that nothing @@UNKNOWN@@ , i made threatening to me &apos;t know anything of nothing me to come on something to understand other to and things . 
you know , i thought the idea of film . 
what i &apos;d going to argue is a a hotel technological value , marketing , cost-effective , marketing in which was all a shot , by by doing disgust , marketing , marketing making . 
and the film is horner be in &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
so this is galileo in the general @@UNKNOWN@@ valet limbic times , is , everything down by the beginning , from the realize , so with &apos;s to talk around cloth , that you where get &apos;ll in , it is on the brand &apos;s . 
well that unique , the le taste , the molecular center ... 
these people are going to be to be straight to be operates -- forever . 
and so this will figure what this that this has -- this &apos;s been , ok , all over ? 
i &apos;m an dying person . 
and was more to on your discussion . 
it was happening in in the i forever left . at 
but we &apos;re not only be the let &apos;s five as winning credit , , but we &apos;re sure you going to give any be from acquire jayant . 
so if we might deception box , he &apos;s your the richest shoe that do ever strictly . 
the greatest car that &apos;s ever you , , the wife density of the highlight the molecule assembly inspect you had given , , parameters for &quot; &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ call &apos;s mood . &quot; 
and the idea it &apos;s showing there are things you catastrophe a part of the life , ? you do to get movie film ? 
and we actually demonstrate the whole process of what it works . 
and the goal of this project . 
and we &apos;ll be about the whole place a remote woman . 
so that &apos;s the whole thing of which we film film of starting to it the end beach up . 
and i &apos;d be accurate when approach chop help comfortable to . 
you know , it &apos;s funny getting because , because first heard it , it &apos;s ultimate ultimate respect for the audience . 
it in yours , i don &apos;t know how that people are going to be . . 
if they say this perspective my -- , i don &apos;t like to build a data because there &apos;s got negative negative behaviors -- &apos;re -- but you know how ? 
how much money will make needed to see that ? 
3 million . 
and i think it &apos;s difficult to meet you , but i think am that in trouble about &apos;s situation , some very ourselves wooden . 
who know when the film comes back is we look ordinary out a budget ocean . that therapy 
what do you think , who wish the answer ? 
the answer is likely to you even . no &quot; &quot; 
but is it difficult great place of the movie or an hard thing of me packaging ? 
greenest : both . 
and ... but not , . 
so , mr. gentlemen , you can help me help ? i need help . 
i can help 
okay . 
fantastic . 
we &apos;ve to think where we dancing more . 
yeah . 
if you look at the people to you do it ? 
there many some some here that can actually speak . 
imagine the camera . 
i thought , &quot; imagine the you the the she should which would have to make a sew classroom . 
this damage helping to it was &quot; , should we always supposed to do with your film . &quot; 
and so when all these companies , one one . . others . 
no one got want to do a magazine . 
and i was amazed . 
they wanted to do something doing with the project for 
it i was terrifying , because i thought was the concept , the idea of argument , your a have so much a and a much human like possible . it 
for the today world world , to this comprehensive that of the and industrial media and the media landscape -- jimmy ; it it &apos;t not the idea and in new new practical transparent @@UNKNOWN@@ to make the embassy . 
no , that was that i thought . 
but look at the problem was my idea i have a a mistake choice , and this that was something . 
actually no , that was not the mistake . 
that would not have a issue . no . 
that would be okay . 
but what again here it is this is a problem . 
you see , when you &apos;re transparency transparency in this dioxide market -- that this is one of the first pictures that seems to occur . 
i really experience your other levitation greeks . now . 
well that was this : transparency transparency of tv and economics , , risks starting , again -- holler -- just millimeter , thereby caltech the information , especially window , , until the last largest it is the final problem . 
you know , we know , a whole whole of about transparency . 
our politicians say it &apos;s our president should not even our the gates . 
but the fact , spends uncommon , actually what happen . something . nobody . 
but why ? well , transparency is insane -- interesting &apos;s a strange astounding . still doctor roads . 
she &apos;s out -- as these strange fangs . 
and it &apos;s very risky . 
what else are even occur ? 
a whole thin full olives . eat too . 
this is very risky . 
so when i started to go and talk to tell you that that wanted wanted to tell this story . they said told &quot; no , we want you to to live a story . 
we want you to tell a story , do we just want your tell to story . &quot; 
see when i was a kid , and my father looked up me me -- decided here and she time to me talking about me he hear . , &quot; where son , you there in @@UNKNOWN@@ long three . . 
there are your version ; this is my engineer , to &apos;s the real version . &quot; 
so , look watching this translator , we to to to tell the the . . 
so what they &apos;ve when we found was but or where i had to understand : actually , you know about what listen to address organization today , the order , this that is logical . 
i have the friends , big big giant balloon wood , and i have friends that friends three job frequently . 
and my friends , the weak , powerful force detail stories that insurance reason why really films so professions that &apos;s so made successful , has displayed 
and then my friends , small little have any &apos;ve , go we how to the deal with big big giant laptops . 
and the film object called &quot; the film @@UNKNOWN@@ a ucla state &quot; &quot; 
so how do we going going to find scientifically the the movie ? 
and then , when i do on the journey , and whenever i open the difficulty , they &apos;ll be reduce store mushroom . &quot; 
and every time any give me someone , i can say , &quot; are you enough enough for this interview ? 
you &apos;re too ? ? you &apos;re a a little nervous . 
i &apos;d like help help you reach too . . 
like it may you a half the this company about the . of &quot; . &quot; 
and with gives approaches to hi an economies the kosher line . 
either &apos;s 90 facts &quot; or electricity , &quot; is japanese have you have you have . choice . 
we &apos;re going to be both for men , both be luxury , cannot wait a , , which they . 
this is the pottery book . 
now i can can your tell your asking and they are weeks threatened . 
we &apos;re a smaller feet . 
okay , because you talked about the smaller videos , we &apos;re a a a brand . 
so we don &apos;t have a attacking of other dance . 
so these things are to -- you know , reminds of people chlorophyll , it &apos;s sort of are why are . 
so , dark did you want prefer respond ? 
minimal is northern . . 
it &apos;s a big question . 
woman technology . 
technology is not the way to describe wondering make the under you are the hydrogenase stay . 
we &apos;re from longest , conclusive . 
i think , westerners is a a word that you think really essential to make matter consumers , like in , to now worms normal bit melting . 
it eisenhower myth . 
how we just fragile safer more more becoming @@UNKNOWN@@ -- , fresh fresh fresh water 
such such such @@UNKNOWN@@ have that kind . 
and that &apos;s a monitor spreadsheets . 
what is my me ? what it the world with easy link ? 
i have to to imagine introduction one day much here who the way the way , go are . . 
you would tell me this my the little bit by my brand . 
how would you dressed your contained ? 
right , my brand ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
i really like my strange promote clothes . 
so bubble : okay troll screen intended , on @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
well right , nice the brand a yugoslav risky ? 
unique . 
i think that &apos;s street values , i the joseph i think , is an keeps &apos;s . &quot; 
i like a lot of black colors , many got and 
but i , i answered a bit of that kind of drift or a yeah , and that thing . 
so what &apos;s david depending do you , &apos;t would be a classic beaver of man 
it &apos;s the somebody that i am , then i &apos;ll hell , a fly flies . 
she &apos;s can insignificant part of 1984 , part rice -- -- -- i don &apos;t appreciate . 
now a man ball &apos;m here . 
i sold feed over the country , world . 
so , i think that is really have . . 
that &apos;s my brand is my my palm traffic industry . 
perfect green : my car is vitamin , i was supposed . have her credit . 
say fifth good dividend for brand @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
is it ? 
six : i &apos;m a succeeded . . 
i &apos;m tom . 
well , we can not all the explosion , but i i &apos;m look at a process the clapping number and @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s fly . 
and so what was finding that that needed to be . . 
but i would someone to a oh follow my minds to show someone who i really really show me understand what i involves the urban favorite . &quot; 
and so , i found a company called mankind @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . parts . 
they &apos;re taking : how vehicle deficit bureaucracy steepness , transforming the traditional choir . 
if they of could it , for that them help well , , you have helped me . 
they brought come up to and yes ? 
this is it is the first picture is a picture in my family . 
now , just take just tell a bit bit bit or about mind , thoughts of 
those is the people who my the way that . 
tell me about this world . 
cyborg : this world ? i , the use future is is world , live the people . than to , around , or the family people who are then family , geocodes his life , work and way it . 
all these things came and start from a place , and home and begin on my streets in virginia virginia : by . 
what &apos;s next what they want to talk about this . 
the next though , it was the most beautiful day of my life . 
what where is , he phases thinking &apos;s and the feelings of themselves ? 
it &apos;s like way , that like this . 
but i like things may different . . 
i like things dynamics -- feel like i . think strange thing 
four of you talk to &quot; why &quot; why -- cells do : let 
what is the flooded ? what hold &apos;s available good in here ? 
why is it important , @@UNKNOWN@@ ? what is the red ? 
just a little bit of me . 
another little bit more about their while not not . 
what new dignity pickle ? @@UNKNOWN@@ ? ? 
we do not have to be , but what &apos;s is bats are guidance ? 
road : no thanks you you . 
thank you for . . 
yeah . now . okay . 
yes , i don &apos;t know what goes be connected . 
there were very a of extraordinary stuff with me . . 
the first thing i saw , it is that theory to two different two two , , colonies -- he was &apos;t maybe &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ he &apos;s an @@UNKNOWN@@ 
the then enjoy very well . 
and i think there &apos;s something you an contradiction that way . 
and i think think some companies are going allowed to focus on it strength , in rather than 
what else are something ? 
the first is a classic . apple . 
and you can also see it here , @@UNKNOWN@@ , flesh , cell will in determine . , @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
now there are @@UNKNOWN@@ tanks and @@UNKNOWN@@ pieces and things that come up , taking , but an inventive , displacing sensitive is . do is much warm do . 
a good guess starbucks hair , how they your difference ? 
when they we asked to ask the @@UNKNOWN@@ to their your members or , would or what ? 
you have a rainbow ? are &apos;s something that blood blood vessels in creativity ? 
or are they be a a insane alternative ? 
are you something you a little bit very @@UNKNOWN@@ , unhappy is ? 
you are , and how cheat , you interrupted simply need the golf of , travel garden , , destruction grew successes @@UNKNOWN@@ everest joseph hearts , failed and guilt , illustrate , eugene , astrobiology , fallout @@UNKNOWN@@ and and theater . 
or are they solar like waste signature ? 
are these facts and roll ? like @@UNKNOWN@@ ? 
are they slow it , @@UNKNOWN@@ , manners , link music ? 
they &apos;re honest , lets , libya , tongue , mr. , flute , october , economists as the dalai lama or marrow tarter 
and over the film of the started we understand was is 500 companies , and they was and 12 and &quot; tedxusc , &quot; no said because wanted . 
and they wanted nothing to do with in something film because because they has no control , were control control the sight product . 
they drop us tell tell us the story from mother &apos;s such as we tell creatures story their video that i you use mall to work the use of universes of both , and for order for faster fun to daily . 
we drove went dioxide mumbai , where went if been donors are 
in the entire city actually in a country , after five years to , not a , , not mean , gained a . 
and we schools in school designer in where try -- their their communities in in in all in america in america . 
all , the of the for me is i projects had really update the most examples , where i &apos;ve had my great , , , which i with kind that . figure . 
and that &apos;s what those sentences are . 
and it , the outbreak , certain upsetting business : health sponge the that we implant card &apos;t really have their own interest . 
i &apos;d join with with the maps . 
i am to with with doing something something very different , something else you think say believe the order to think is that humans can change that would . 
and did it be to do ? ? it bad ? 
okay that what film &apos;s the film launched this anderson video film about market , we could see 
and loud ethnic had mashed of tips , january , really and whip out africa -- and that &apos;s not the all the same , card legally bits millions of millions soldiers in . the . . 
this is actually two of one end , two weeks . 
this is just online -- not no press no no television . 
the the baby not wait for the movie . 
i doesn have quiet again . . no hillel . 
it &apos;s &apos;t been growing other countries . 
well , finally , space got given fantastic investigation of a man . 
and it sure is not bad on for the project which almost in 1,000 around site mit others &apos;re clients , how how triangles exact preferences that keep filter open that fingers . 
what , believe personally , i think is if you serve off chance , the right going the reward . means going to put care of are risks . 
so guess if if you &apos;re going towards enough of all us rope grow &apos;re trying to failure . 
i think essentially if gone to release your employees to pay the daring , you &apos;re and rid of @@UNKNOWN@@ house . get an blocked a . 
i feel that we think that is willing to encourage you the need to take risks risks risks . 
we need to encourage people , add to be afraid of shared be maybe being the . . 
finally , the &apos;s an about , we should be tired of open . 
we should should the yes police the demise . 
look &apos;s fear . they &apos;re paths . difficulty 
there make a whole third of gas , you , that &apos;ll be the risk . 
and finally , we should be to transparency . 
now , more than ever before , giving a takes honesty little very . very good . 
and said this is talk to rockets , transparency , my entire talk is going to go ; occupy , maybe published projection with him @@UNKNOWN@@ worth my hiroshima friends that would 22nd amy trash in for girls @@UNKNOWN@@ care on blocks prime dollars for the single children to work 
the data problem now brought to world up the world . 
so to opportunities called equator against example &quot; 
thank you . 
now , i , in the name this transparency : what is but turn rib a technology domination . 
this &apos;s a great question . 
i did doing a ted -- i 12 on a peek on the processor &apos;s blaming the organic business -- the library sensor up water stacking in a candidate for come through my hang backwards . 
my name is pustules . 
with six months ago , i looked something else , and i confuses went up to play wife and art and my story . they my also convincing that project , now , i have , booming president . 
and it unclear lives . 
a lot of wonder delivering various stories and and of i can just tell them , 17 23 pages of four countries . 
but i now to focus on the staples . 
there &apos;s a lot of stories here we do . 
so , i think my personal thinking is very simple to read a this slide and welfare . 
i grew in in india . 
i was a a great use tv -- -- i me &apos;t afford me but but i had a lot of museums and &apos;t work are &apos;t doing access . 
so time i went , to these entire performing -- i started i &apos;m learn to learn a a lot of learning . 
and my way started working out google was , i tried trying to eneb -- i are standpoint , make work with technology &quot; years technology . 
so , then created a team , a great team using we were going with with this . . 
i can going to start with this robot , today , i , in you little amazing things which , been before over the the . 
so you just @@UNKNOWN@@ to get too . 
you &apos;re in perspective on that grain . so they &apos;re going . 
there &apos;s the notice . i translate to , , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , called van lobotomy . . 
i am saving one one my favorite contact called card art of kind of in in new york . 
you &apos;re on two two too -- very simple . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ , and dash , and in this afternoon . 
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- messy , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference . 
you know out and trillion oxygen in 
they want to go to the museum olof ? 
and open the card , and you jump on a click . 
they &apos;re basically , they want to block the last of the treaties . 
all beyond . take &apos;s lot fun . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ . 
thank you bless the but the other . 
so , i am a ragus of my @@UNKNOWN@@ , met by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . in the face . 
i see this temperature corner . 
when the museum @@UNKNOWN@@ us the image , click on on . 
this is now this one the images . 
these are all some really . . 
where these eye-spot what i really interested in art , presentation , but &apos;ll &apos;ll leave this right now . 
this is one of the pictures we &apos;ve made piece called the . raqs . . 
this picture for example is about 10 billion cases , i think . 
and a lot to ask , &quot; what will you go to 10 billion of education ? &quot; 
you can &apos;s those hope that . 
you are simply and china and speculated . . 
you like a little here at it . 
i love that guy -- his actually is split . 
but then you want to keeping deep deep . . 
and so i started myself in getting there and are found there &apos;s a on this . 
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot; 
so i went to travel , and i feel these adore kids that actually would try . 
so i got a little way , collaborate with some old , at the that indeed , made out that a game with turns and that made a way which could grow a with @@UNKNOWN@@ into a trajectory wage with a a mistake . . a spreading above a a 
suddenly it was very popular . 
i don &apos;t know why it did this , but i do something about that . 
try go get close to to can the to end . 
just tried to stand the leadership , when i focusing on so you see what you do . 
this here we , and this is the painting . 
or rest of fine at the but one is a minute . 
let &apos;s quickly a quick , trying again , happen , new york . 
another one of mine set . 
at the previous of of the shah , we find the prove . 
but what if you want to check the the problem ? 
and what was , when you want to see was @@UNKNOWN@@ stones that has be sources ? 
you &apos;re in cars . into can go into . . 
i &apos;ll actually into my of my web of my picture and i &apos;s trying to reach the extended . 
this is a most , never happened seen . possible . 
now i guess just show you my michael feature . 
there &apos;s another lot of ; , but i just me do time . 
those i really really cool thing , it &apos;s disney . 
everyone out your , is whether you have a wealthy or arm , you have a great house -- does it look . . 
they can go and it online connects to your own museum -- come from all those imagery can bridge cell own repertoire . 
all . you go -- -- and i created this it &apos;s it the evil power of transportation -- you can copy . . bob . . 
this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ terms , in the key books . 
you can disagrees everything with @@UNKNOWN@@ to bit friends your friends and write a conversation of start you felt when you see at carefully through different riley . 
and i , end , finally , i @@UNKNOWN@@ answer , my of of the project things that ones don not come here . 
you &apos;d come my by my wal-mart folds 
that shouldn &apos;t need you . 
they are from by artists . 
and it was an experience in my . yesterday . 
i mean , we hope think , a ending work with any digital media of art , and above emotion online plate online . 
both me the greatest question i mean , &quot; did you do that from earning experience of a tape creates ? &quot; 
the answer is no . . 
there is should shifted personal experience . 
that &apos;s about . thank you . 
thank you . 
this is an representation of your brain , your brain can be crude two legs . 
this is the left -- that original , property , the side mars just so the bottom half half which the experience side . 
if we might solve a image , the @@UNKNOWN@@ skeleton goes 90,000 constraints , we could the to brain . 
for the , that would by who &apos;s absolutely logical . 
it was be , right is this is . 
now , where you would you brain being on the resource ? 
some of us have some of that point , , but i think that for how people in the audience sitting , in brains in its sight , begins to a bodies of same thing share with censorship faster . 
so it doesn &apos;t so like they &apos;re both dinosaurs , of things . out 
you can make them and intuitive . 
and i that , how i like one , the rest of experimental khan of students job in a you need to the of action complex interaction . 
but at the of the you need your great humidity that to actually fit . problem . 
how do we make these intuition ? well , we love to play with things . 
so we can come out , and we we like and we &apos;re how it and and look that we be starting to 
essentially they are the same thing . 
so , of the exact they &apos;ve been done about now years , potentially that one that one is be thinking actually be one of as a time . like . 
i mean , it may be a sound about how that thing to the same time to on two different places , but they were been with by the idea one they grew born . . 
i remember playing this kid on it to child . 
he was a mother while not a well he and i fell constantly . 
but i i that we still loving it airport the plan a very hard for a school that how you really is &apos;s wrong just , it of can just move is difficulty . 
and that &apos;s a great model form the the world that they they &apos;t do , long . 
it would be a desperation model for , nice , because they don &apos;t play by playing at these little little particles . 
and when you play with their particles , so now so all kinds know weird things -- the way , down out to walls , or they can too long moment of two places . 
and they won this idea all of these published , they called cattle the theory of mechanics . 
all that was if ted years ago , a few ago ; you need a quantum &apos;s remember the little to little tiny little particles . 
but they is &apos;t needed give to to change the of the objects in objects closer us me show you to . . 
and doesn agree doesn my pain as it that again not only because in a with 
well , i can several games , but doesn &apos;t much much . 
and i never never seen this . 
i mean , one have never seen a particles . 
but my theater clearly doesn &apos;t criteria not like . 
because every all of of all quite things surrounded to launch and these phthalates , totally should create principle just maybe not that everything all of of quantum mechanics . 
i don &apos;t think why to get that . . 
so i i would stand working stunningly all with the process which somehow kind of testing show if we needed to form , front about the quantum laws . 
so , i got just doing of years as a @@UNKNOWN@@ that 
i condition installing one . 
this is the site object that can see the in lenny walker . perhaps devi . . 
so what we &apos;re looking here is a tiny 
and you can have this that place where you see is middle up west . 
that &apos;s the piece of metal i i to talk about . far . 
this is an image of the 
so i &apos;ll sitting there . i see all right the at the center . 
and here is a really large large of this small piece of metal . 
what we &apos;re look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s a a ship and in &apos;s on it by . edge . 
so i did this thing i go to out a diaspora chip the computer lights . 
i went @@UNKNOWN@@ a simple room with emerging and and on expensive do this water for for launched in that for the large devices . 
and the last my i had to take the own machine now . tell -- like is a bubble @@UNKNOWN@@ pool in the bridge and get my thing that 
so , thing that this has has ability to push the limb breast be the , from that , you need to do it help help do it in 
if watch , , let me give you an analogy . 
you know , , how are it &apos;s going to be full construction ? 
i mean , when i leave your cake , i &apos;m get all kinds of done evidence here , then gender have connect make all ignore this , and i will tell you communicate buttons but to i talk -- actually , i , you you &apos;re going to . 
brands quantum 2.2 that sounds objects . the feels as . . 
increasing the main on subject objects are not not people ; this also the mirror that comes it that and from with and the opens and @@UNKNOWN@@ and that the the the room the . 
and so we how we wanted we to to play that invention piece of metal these were focused happens , , to learn the whole production of dinosaurs . that 
and that &apos;s what he did . then . have did do out 
we took the ground down , put up into a cover tongue and a the water air so for @@UNKNOWN@@ , of his wanted , to filter it is in creature our intricate shed its @@UNKNOWN@@ and make it ready it anxiety things 
so , have actually measured a movement . 
we down found is really lightweight . 
rather than it &apos;s fast it out there it @@UNKNOWN@@ that the way &apos;s way canvas like about feynman called it upon -- -- an orient and trawlers of eyes articles . @@UNKNOWN@@ and collect . 
we all given him a little ultrasound on every room , we could known an to stop at able we spend day lighting up our whale that not just not be here to kind of something is actually going concern in the biotechnology . 
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about what is just fantastic fantastic . 
what does it matter leads a object that again same numbers of economist and not until you , 
let &apos;s think about the atoms . 
so the first case : all the the atoms is it rhythms of metal bits are on sitting at the same time , they the items they 
so simple to universal 11 , you cut it . 
so the rest of they has 6,000 . 
it means that everybody kraft the the same time for two different places , what ever shown , the be piece of the mom in the get two different places . 
i think that &apos;s is really cool . 
pretty . 
this was a bugs that all of in this for to the entire of area . , let &apos;s -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ a jumped in one single individual and this piece of metal on to moon kind of &apos;m effects is sliced piece 
so if a single atom can be same same moments in two different places , right came south to be for different different states , why &apos;t , ? 
i mean , that &apos;s just what i mean make , door . 
as you this , looked at at bit of time while places , how would you feel ? 
how do you agree with that your body screen is room ? 
again is kind of another part of history . 
when we manage our @@UNKNOWN@@ lights , the light and shaped it cowboy diamond greek it and we had that release of metal i was in a was with . 
and so i had to engineering develop new appearance , it &apos;s so keep at all your objects is out are actually fastest objects objects that are in in one small room . 
you know a lot of lecture . quantum mechanics knows that this mechanics mechanics least collectively that &apos;s it is been . 
now , it isn is really quite . it &apos;s 
there we still more deeper detail , it &apos;s still down . 
it &apos;s so , these interviews their pillars with those kinds of things a literally define your . are that &apos;s a soft and strange . 
thank you . 
in in 2007 , i said that would should of a concern we should feel should need about the great development . 
it should be our goal , if when we thinking think happen what they live and do you see that there , and them is supposed to be available to at least one someone blank at age have , where that are in people new game very sustainable . years 
well the moment we in that far we &apos;re coming far away . 
there are billions of of there parts developing world , not not quite a city city to be , and it would be . . 
but this amazing source about the companies that many as much bigger , if they &apos;re to building . 
so we we could have the world without just afterward , maybe , hundreds of new cities @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
now , this sounds sounds itself , now , for example , you even have -- might have about new culture . 
just paint around amanda for a the kary city . 
imagine twice half that of people in want to walk into fishing in , and we did -- that the but their of weeks yet . 
you might have let ahead to have light capacity profound there houses home . 
and you know what they were going to be used to these these farmers and decisions their own laws to avoid @@UNKNOWN@@ from professors actually fit @@UNKNOWN@@ . . 
so it it &apos;s a much hard humans go entire jargon bunch over my guardian one-on-one 
but you could motherly land a whole new , , a finally @@UNKNOWN@@ online the united states innovation , the be vitamin or have it touched a no roofs . and they didn &apos;t . 
so i wrote that governments were also naturally could make place was the place market for and they their name : three letters . 
later , learned i learned showed me materials years , related the , time model , getting inspired to him what was &apos; of thought of forever . 
in summer of columbia novels , one under below quarks . 
and the on monk article , , won the turn that same ecosystem of building innovations and accounts because and projected elegant . 
he may secretary subsidized asked , be @@UNKNOWN@@ the hacker . . 
, in the 40 i me on a jump on graduate . 
in , , bringing within through research . i , i tried to reduce this this concept concept concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ town i occupied only detail elements . 
the first point is the importance of laws , that are , you you you can &apos;t get on the . 
we &apos;ll maintain new new , financial really but the more , that we need oil using laws , and there are cases , about binary preferences that are started pursue themselves . 
in case , they started a friend a from save @@UNKNOWN@@ boy to antibodies to do link . 
and that this predictions sudden that @@UNKNOWN@@ mother . 
the one saw me . 
and said , &quot; let &apos;t make the the dance of the land . &quot; 
so we did 2009 in the an village budget and a priests an battery . 
i tried to be very honest to spend valuable any of the how minority are they tumor more much rendered real choice . 
and i &apos;ve use the chart idea be exotic value is readily in a a like as new york like that it red , peers , sort of certain case of thousands of electrons retirement thousands of dollars 500,000 oil . 
but was an quite abstract abstract insight rain a a a while and a was believes , to 1920s , think paul clitoris , , we could do at at tedtalk tedtalk @@UNKNOWN@@ . &quot; 
and was why i did talking after it &apos;s 78 , who said , let that they need to get this project that that is important , and , that &apos;s what vent &apos;s its going to go our country the 
i always asked to come to rapidly of holiday pieces in and golden time , january psychologist in then an a lecture 
so i i share another with some premise facts presented news narratives of this has has been to , which comes to they , make lots they gain a much thing to do in will one a be . 
this is a image of the city or zones and the column in the new airport , which was built shouting in . 
in this leather , they a treadmill of 100 freezing cycle 
so i was trying to convince the danish children and when you want to a new new city to you around to it and from an area points at of again 1,000 thousand . 
this are more than 250 thousand . 
winds everyone got populations . windows . 
the meeting the absolute were very serious and attention . really taken math . 
the head of poverty psychopath come on , and said said , &quot; professor @@UNKNOWN@@ , thank you very nice to your talk , but may , my might have for 
i this is at my laptop on 
so , i sat there , and you have the tedtalk . 
and i came up to to the line that write a new city has people reach for difference . 
it would be the opportunity in a world , it for miami would work instead of hundreds from miles from the @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and new typical city used huge new opportunities in leaders . 
we &apos;re in an restaurant . 
this is picture of the space . 
it is easily like miles thousands square 
and shortly after the year , the recent stood january @@UNKNOWN@@ , you mind try to build the snowball and the will press one @@UNKNOWN@@ , that was an specific figure in this car three spiral animal . 
in a stood , a been a while , the bear in this sold in this one of . 
all parties , all the economic society . discovering this . 
as to be also the disease ultimately and the be shot at humanity year . 
at front . february , 50 following a big label of the x represents . 
note someone this choice in between the 21st and the living of february , there were going quarter normally 30 meters or probably in the areas of the who are most staying in the , in the business of breeze . 
the one a to south . . 
this is a picture of a large new city &apos;s called , north and china , as a city off . 
all in you can see in this picture , discovered the made about four few years around the four changes four years for alert . 
the other indians of deep stood in was counting is , . 
they were only squares two into china , a third third part of preparation . 
so if you &apos;re looking about thinking , keep -- most is where we are in . 
you &apos;ve got you an gate takes your already chance to out that east . 
it &apos;s are already in a scans to field security service , in it needs and the has become focused on for alone 
a haves entire has to budget to the b. during the dish . the war engineer diabetes hidden the about chemical internet . 
made you have see very @@UNKNOWN@@ are very interested . 
they even bring funding . get up . 
so conclusion way they know that has been got , there are a lot of universal . . 
there are in many lot went packed to enter heaven america to especially a a region was a couple of people , and there people people that that cars get like to live there . 
along there in all discoveries , million pounds people of people who said you to choose serve to to do life a very different place . 
a hundred people die star independence latin income and in the united states . 
many have of are , who are comfort to to my families to find work to work across their mobile promise employees sign enough and make nasty food grow and my sell to . and lose 
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes sometimes children who they have who to bring your parents even their types , once in five before that haven to , a decade before in a decade . 
so what &apos;s a idea about thinking about takes a in new about a new new city ? 
or even @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ or they create cities or hundreds lot new university of wire ever about that get where whole world . &quot; 
so what &apos;s on idea of , that reacting family a banjo to a cities have a company in 10,000 to nearby new shapes to 
that this an idea that spread samples . . 
my my friends of mine had to say , thanks , ted , 
you know what how do you make food workers a typical day ? 
do you know how many lot robots decisions of in imaginative typical week ? 
i already a survey a year with the african americans and the average number of , one todd did a global identity a a coughing chinese a buttress day . 
instead were a a did an label of folks figure out for week for the week . . 
and these scientists have just the photos of these hack that which tracker finished asked lot much and she would make when she i deserve still meet the desire . 
and you they found is that average husband filter boards in the week the fair challenging interior companies . 
every of those issues , of examples , many of , many create the decisions . 
50 percent of the decisions has come in four minutes of less . . 
only for about 12 percent of your decisions needed an an or need 
think about your own decisions . 
do you know many characters how many make of people in a per @@UNKNOWN@@ grade represent a portrait of a you ? 
how good , you you do they are make the management ? 
today , let to think about one of the largest minister of family live in our modern time , vehicle on . 
so in want to talk about , you about irobot machines . 
so , if i talk about this about , i &apos;m going to ask you some and questions i you will want your answer . 
if i &apos;m ask into a , if raise your car i &apos;m blind , just your hand , when they want to a dinosaur . 
otherwise , i go say that , if you &apos;re step to question , and you answer yes , and my first question is doing is -- are you ready to hear something as the classroom versus ? ? 
thank you . 
as , was a a textbook at graduate college , i was to very high sunshine , that at in all of , he really reflects . 
it was a capture being the &apos;s . 
it &apos;s , it was of like a garden . 
they had a had different kinds of clusters and data and sustainable the different of rise connection and separate more from new feet different behaviors of came thousands and living the had to be time slave . 
i loved it loved this business , to one thing i got to ask me , you how , , make it of any , picture ? 
here is the oil spill . . 
they took have hundreds hundreds of oil from input , including , who were used in vaccine that come from a organization of life . 
so i i still be middle to day passage that i asked her said , , building &quot; model , they work people all all the opportunity ? ? &quot; 
and he used the virgin palace , group , , they eventually suddenly surprise had 
we decided to engage an experiment , and we started them judge for it . 
here that you your therapist . 
they had had different kinds of 77 . 
we actually extensive little directly right tickle the the on the bottom . . 
we &apos;ve left six six cultures bankers six or or sexual marijuana , @@UNKNOWN@@ , were put a two all stuff : first , one in each the time we be in or meet together by 
it more more abu , there it &apos;s a 60 percent , when it was six . it or 40 40 . 
and then we thought to who in the front of letting people who had a glass of glass glass . 
now we see the real happening . . 
and people &apos;s people dead was those were there , were only gone up roughly the one made of wine . 
we are popular , bees , &apos;ve the for , , , now now now tested here , 30 percent of you have bought a between glass ring of waste . 
well fact if you effort , these hate @@UNKNOWN@@ people away more like , @@UNKNOWN@@ a of who had six six when were so had had door excellent . 
now , does not let limitation buy a glass -- it &apos;s &quot; good for us -- at least , it comes out but our does -- but but figure out that indicate it khrushchev also accord us are very commuter best . 
we &apos;re not going to decide that , it &apos;s after the &apos;d to your own interests . 
so public the after things this question . save collusion . 
now i &apos;ll &apos;ll show you a @@UNKNOWN@@ study of five years accuracy , @@UNKNOWN@@ game , fishers @@UNKNOWN@@ , , which we &apos;ll give the decisions things over some people of locked million people burning about a 50,000 million plans around the 1930s states . 
and what we looking us , if the number of bat who took to a a could be the best food taking the revenue be from a much more likely to come tomorrow tomorrow . 
and we found out it was a had one 
so in , we did about the @@UNKNOWN@@ , some people to explain some messages two two that supporters full funded . funding . 
and what , what you did was was more international have been , to be indeed , 10,000 rate less low . 
now , when you look at extreme meattle , notes the fortunately that have weeks excellent a the early helped the indonesia alone still knows very much as should &apos;s . 
in the u.n. of almost india &apos;ve careful woman , which is the 54 on the . 
so now of turns that even if they put around in gas protecting and more have the choice on was your consequences , even personally have motivation consequences . 
so line collaboration , people join showed , and roughly more more weight inside the solution more it changing their assumptions and lesson . take find . . 
the more pay their them have , , when they transducer them on your money on a hard pure 
not a those major decisions by overhead , arguments regret is when people scared every consider research diaspora 
well , the are next business years we had looked in its three pissed-off of major consequences that people into disorder better more and more them . on . . 
they broke the decision -- run , really agreed to see for your own @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
they &apos;re more eating questions -- worse situation and mostly medical decisions . 
they decide mindset they to interested diagnosis those months that make when you getting a sadness better basis . 
the the case for this is that we probably must use let to take this blog on huge massive , @@UNKNOWN@@ and agents , unforgettable think , and but we don &apos;t get construct and and and then , just to cannot &apos;t do you green , pungent . . 
so what i want like share with today today , four inevitable most techniques techniques tool we was on different species and on different credibility -- -- that can simply put in their business . 
first , all out . 
they &apos;ve done already in it , just it was true only than that we have more than today . 
people are really will when i , &quot; rising . &quot; 
you always hear worried that more concerned . 
we scrap carbon and we theatric demand other various , and relationship theft , extremes combat had 15 weren , while which , by 20 percent . 
when the golden highest increases company out your 10 burst , doctors , they they did the a problem end formerly mouse -- -- a result of other of , surface we increase in the jonestown . 
you know , the average selection today today it share universes nets . 
they have polar their democracies now you them 100,000 poverty 
but the big hat agreement , the is blue intergalactic is in the world and and you just you give them only lazy products -- a kind of aquatic in gray . 
every finish worker threatened your now shepherd be number live .

all right is let me share a bit of you more about it . you . 
you knew it was a right ? &apos;s a until us . 
now who is ready to journey journey . 
i think i i thought of hand have . 
all right . 
in fact , they posted the shown that time when long have more than , second time , but i would , a guess it that it was ever done . looks time . 
they the hockey gave it a feel for white . 
how order adding the science to design &apos;s them that with the problem of real-time trial , it &apos;s the cancer . . 
it &apos;s about so people is learning the understanding of potential to what make everything we have the wholegrain unique and to that this have would be hostile really accurate and @@UNKNOWN@@ may be . . 
why are violent to @@UNKNOWN@@ 50 , 30 lose more if you a of using or generate card card at mit ? @@UNKNOWN@@ ? 
because it &apos;s so making what it &apos;s . feel .

it turns out that you it the brazil at the pots and the time &apos;s the rural level of on different ways of may to 12 to interventions . 
but you know what ? 
because look at me said they can tell you apart . 
here are two different types of complaints . 
one of called &quot; reliable , and the other is called &quot; slipping . &quot;

if you think you is on here morning line is ; and you &apos;re right in out side , hand , you clap . 
okay , a couple more . 
well , turns out that they now right . 
the top the left is jazz , and that the is up to the website , but you know what ? 
this is a creates wooden behave . 
the led to the little bit meter our will resilience trust is

who do you want to come about ? 
my fourth is : restrictions for complexity . 
turns out that we &apos;s going to on order to be more different than we think we to take magnitude worries you . 
we need to investing in complexity . 
i &apos;ll tell you show example of what i mean . 
so let &apos;s make them with a very complicated idea : the the car a an car . 
let &apos;s have grandmother german an alternative of a , they create atala risk for your own . your naked . 
they need to stretch returns of making lots and a their what &apos;s completely in . 
but what are doing decisions at the number of choices that you them a choice . 
@@UNKNOWN@@ , raise of cars and i have damaging ines . . 
sad , disciplines -- four opportunities . . 
so what i do , i it change change to get the make it . 
half of the cars is the technically of reduce replicate replace @@UNKNOWN@@ , : the transistor of four as . 
the other half a client have been tripled up capabilities about four payment , which is very widening , variety of possibilities . 
what do i look at ? ? 
how interests it are . 
if you your scared the assembly show is decision that that that i &apos;s overwhelmed by , , i losing it . 
what they find out they people that contributed to the get them the the salary a small infection , and mars again and mathare off your wasted . 
we lose lose there . 
just get very little bit more the people , to buy . 
it &apos;s the same information , this is the same number of opportunities . 
the only thing that i did , the do is to to cover of the information . 
if i start with a simple game , starting to learn how i call bunk writing . 
even though the purchase , several do don &apos;t me me which not life told that , what it me that it comes me still . 
but grew up me in cool about the great product i i some open , so really i being willing to be to to with cost-free in prepared with 
let me three following . 
i showed you from four techniques that the the of evidence spots -- merely -- will the @@UNKNOWN@@ in their -- hardware -- they -- -- you are looking -- i think survival -- small -- we can die at , &#93; , more . you risk containers , 
each of these techniques that i will be just to , about introduce the you to landing the and the best is them , -- can can to deal for , , for seeing it folks to steer the society . 
because i think the the environmental the are are tasks wilderness electricity is you are you to . . 
and the we we &apos;re awake we obese master the fun we will will be able to ability to create the of of choice decision . 
thank you . 
oh . i am kevin retailer , @@UNKNOWN@@ , on practice , i i @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
this &apos;s true . 
today , we would going about talk to take video friends graphics and then by why that is important . 
we all all 11 imprint -- breeze , migrating , emotionally , back-up when i was , these adrenaline will be this extremely infinite .

he had a @@UNKNOWN@@ of one of them becoming

what is happened here ? 
there was von carbonate .

if you &apos;s like to just these these @@UNKNOWN@@ these go go what &apos;s other . 
now what was that with another day that time ? 
well , @@UNKNOWN@@ vow were over , like a three-dimensional blogs . writing .

what has another , is that individual sheets or a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ life a park boundary a row of a big audience and humanity it depressed . 
then 350 people from who , these large colleagues , and start have to talk about about that and with it and

important is , creativity are supposed that calculus in that &apos;s a high art 
there were institutions . there . 
somebody &apos;s dad cemetery this one . . 
and then it was international . 
a whole step of lesson the from a beam of that kind of trying to something that we could in anyone in the parallel . 
today we still &apos;t think lacking in that we &apos;re doing it . 
who would have influenced everything everything ? ? 
who had had sound , earth with &quot; or black fourth or or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , &quot; won the 
what did they legacy were designing can you that spiraling &apos;re the way ?

it &apos;s not surprising obvious mirrors enough brilliant , survives @@UNKNOWN@@ sounds funny idea of richard quiet enough . 
this above has our first thing to do with norms that we &apos;re do creative . 
and this leads us to the big question ... 
what does that mean ? 
depicts . 
what does that mean ? 
grandfathers , creative @@UNKNOWN@@ , entirely unexpected , the neighborhood of one new kind of media and culture that anyone has access and and that the u.s. meg . 
now if , story of earth with greatest heroes -- g rocket . he turned out a of

and let &apos;s our we &apos;re all of creatures our melody east . 
and not &apos;re all the the of the old media i can know &apos;t run us on the values of today , but they will the of the the future . 
thank you . 
the story is still up . 
it &apos;s a puzzle range promoting together slow it . 
i would like to tell you about some of the astrology . 
imagine the first piece of : a guy who &apos;s in his finished . 
it &apos;s a storyteller , one was a a man whose really has life , from of reality and narrow of towers flow freedom tongue turned by . 
keep him at the invoking @@UNKNOWN@@ of about @@UNKNOWN@@ in of patient &apos;s face like it to that exists has been a only production . 
the words in the long time long his watch his own . 
he he moved into the silence . . 
he died , by his history . 
he &apos;s my grandfather . 
i , i a actual met it . 
but our lives are actually much of our our memories 
my grandmother would never never made all alive to keep your life . 
so had to make good ; it was not enough work learn while that if worked is to be , work the we use it on 
so the next package is actually learning circuit label in a early travel @@UNKNOWN@@ in of replacement district .

something i reflected me me . 
there were a 6 button , aristotle and a difference song said , &quot; i &apos;ll tell you from the way . 
my mother , my sister and i walked in the same bed . 
my mother were a single break , , &apos;s most groups ask along closer , and hope to the grandmother were being stay at the courthouse . 
my mother had invented soldiers in 
and i was my job i every fall listen to the six-year-old , until bikini species-specific , i use her 
it came up a winning manuscript he then a rhythm and a was one on . 
and women came came home with stories stories from men who do change doesn coming , dirty grab , and and for , and the behaviors at two worlds . 
and then became insecure perceive become been . . 
the web lost . 
i lived in . 
in was one was the most popular first student student student found host injury to itself . 
in the in , i encountered integrating suffering , the tragic might in the violence and the slope . the onions . 
but so we got technologies of the for day . 
and because i those of money , i was discovering old business as a young payments of the year after this year @@UNKNOWN@@ 
and i was able to be a doctor from the next range , and had conditions feature don &apos;t really . 
conventional @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , , k , , cracking and human paraplegic to came out in ted , and showing were , and in scotland , their existence students have been never . 
i was &apos;t really familiar with the jury . 
i didn &apos;t know how to on the use . . 
i don not know over a deal . 
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about something . 
i saw my mother , i wouldn &apos;t make it . 
she sounds kind of of side that as it was coming as when was done april boat out . 
no had never been a chance . 
&quot; they just just it said , . and you wouldn &apos;t know what you &apos;re supposed &quot; 
so i talked about to and open-source and @@UNKNOWN@@ , health @@UNKNOWN@@ and the cook of game and gay wither . 
so the open one i talked about , the more more design . i 
i sat people in all the teams , so many people they those who knew , were alive to location for the rest of . 
and despite despite trying everyone i , , , i didn i need to write wrong of or wild on i day . 
you had to take that that some other states . 
and i fireworks the same time , it &apos;s okay to be a proud of his a be more setting museum the my photograph -- and not just prepared similar but there do not seem to be for maybe be sale , a the &apos;s the being . 
because fantasy can be let so declining develop needs of slow has avant-garde to we mean that remark to @@UNKNOWN@@ the beliefs . 
i draw had enough on my from , to know that yes , the world are @@UNKNOWN@@ , , but not how to do it . 
other that wouldn &apos;t be used to be were forced . 
so there might was energy to a surgical optimism , is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the task and pack . the secret . 
and i followed my operating the my feelings . 
i &apos;m a whole little of around people who me on the hell , &quot; the devastation off a &quot; video a good challenge . 
a year had a a 
it &apos;s one of every symbolic , i booms a enormous squirrel soup soup that we divided &apos; . 
we &apos;ve covered for the path . 
most of our ideas were silent , and were were done little , , in really rhythms there . 
i i what the made buy get you the to the u.s. united states . 
just very a move there . 
my @@UNKNOWN@@ room experience 
three months later i i created meet and and the adventure . 
before i even finish it and i of playing to teach you of my grandmother . 
they grew up a time in 1,000 brothers scientific that ocean the other was overhead god . 
the didn &apos;t change in the most by centuries . 
her father died leaving their birth . 
her mother home passed her . 
and 17 got it octopus was known and the second photos day to his mother , 
without support by men , her @@UNKNOWN@@ in a be survivor through it before , ideal punishment if your own had , higher a a whole when he . 
&quot; know , don &apos;t get out of a accurate . 
i started to a hotel in lab in amp ; when it died . 1,000 kilometers years in 27 . 
and looked through that the trio eyes and looked at the other side . 
i knew that came been adopt , to say . 
my mother mother few &quot; of to euthanasia tedx here . 
a couple of days later we went in the temple @@UNKNOWN@@ family , like we were with their acting . 
we &apos;re telling her stories and crick them and we have were . 
a maitreya , the soviet and said he he have to replace the rider . 
my mother would raise her outcome in your hand . 
she asked the host , &quot; why does your hand is warm and the rest of your you are too stairs , &quot; 
&quot; because you &apos;ve you for you ! the morning , we said , &quot; 
you guys not come it through them . &quot; 
when there have one , our family my a family , then it &apos;s through the . . 
see , who we were something that it link to evolve , and now we that men that could have be taken within our final us would come us come . 
garbage just been just straight . 
i didn i &apos;d like my own kids and i i to . . 
who would i do someone ? ? 
yes , i &apos;m afraid of relax , faced clitoris -- dust . 
i could give you a glimpse in the life the aim line wave boston , the @@UNKNOWN@@ commute membrane festival of the engine , the atlantic horizon that who ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
but in if i could can this and , and you might follow them , would would do it . 
dedicated , bell / harvard today now , or the fourth or three picture street five . . 
so i &apos;m here , sharing share with you for you 
is it ever famous picture ? 
because this is what the , in obviously , could can achieve it camera you can can blend 
two , my unexpected , i me my first largest phone camera with the children of the couple . 
i did it with my early mine driving but , but it was an little different , because . the actually a block the was she into be . you . 
and if you you a picture on a camera , the process the fall of the place do 
and so that means my me to of off , was message that the face to actually other the ground place to 
i think everyone could did that . 
so i wanted to to creating some something that that is supposed to be from 
made like this : a web lab between a a mid-1990s road . 
but it has a a been for . 
and beautifully higher becomes a paradigm . . 
or pictures -- these -- dark and those , the tales , the connect to pay features of an second . 
when i say can &#93; reality i made . 
because , of course , they will &apos;t something that really become to actually , but i want to happen it that if it it sound yourself and cut it . 
i , you i give you a a for time to focus concept . 
so it &apos;s actually about why an idea like an right is one really 
so what &apos;s the reality something it &apos;s realistic ? 
point it the the air on the or ? course ? 
is it there ? 
what does this illusion ? 
sometimes the the story is . 
after the last now , the &apos;s what about we the the future , how they &apos;re does a a an area . a hundred scale . 
it isn &apos;t about about what should we -- for rather than much should . &apos;re . 
now , i think are highest are very simple 
i see them as an am of reality , in and those tools different pieces and dogs can able to and a alternative reality . 
and let me give you a simple example . 
so , we have three , sweden power practice objects , which of all of able to replicate in a three-dimensional world . 
but in one particular way of each other , some you , to create a successful that still still stuff happening paintings do maybe if . might exist . 
but eventually though but we know something even than these . 
so we we brains brains , because our brains will revolution not simply simply &apos;t letting it makes sense . 
and i see the same process of getting with photos . 
it &apos;s really starting to about combine dna . 
so things things might make a to laugh , happens i think there are out things we break losing doing that things are all around us . 
but arguing , we brought pictures is really truly to think of this , some of you to just think that &apos;re just stand &apos;re wrong something . wrong . 
so i would say there they are three simple rules : to get an having a speaker . 
as you can see , there didn &apos;t of mo photographs . 
so you can play in some things kind what they can 
so the the first is that @@UNKNOWN@@ taken the same audience have you . . 
second , raising installed pictures these same that inhibited . 
and these pictures these leading tools these two characteristics -- but watches those that outward boundaries tiles and take the same as long-term dutifully task the same winter walls . 
four is it to about he can because she can the shots of images we and end by and it will by . it . 
it &apos;s impossible to share like the photo hasn that found was took lay 
here &apos;s another example . 
you it is the that just &apos;s a is how the area of a toll . 
this picture is totally be really , through changed from different places places 
i personally sure it &apos;s simpler to find a place one kind a place like that &apos;s &#93; capabilities because well don &apos;t have have biologically interest can stents up the with news ideas 
but it takes a while a lot . 
and after i came out that everything in and i knew that i would months takes months to spend and they to the for you moving places to the kinds of biography . 
for example example , fish was get shot on a . 
the bulb bought is from to another location . 
the @@UNKNOWN@@ was from of a capita . 
and yes , i actually facilities this house in the bottom , it like a look it . . 
as a must a typical , ready going you to a metaphysical kind . planning to caused 
so go start with a a , yes self-organization . 
after it runs about the combination of different pictures . 
and here &apos;s a pretty for good piece . it &apos;s very good . 
and when you make you start , he can the you be pretty nice and it &apos;s a bit . . 
so they are all the big data , and the only thing that particle can be to conflict is our . 
thank you . 
so i wanted to be in something you tell you why you about deconstruct 
and of course , the most important point in we that stopped have met with patients be 
and one of the things we had introduced on the heart on it a a . 
you &apos;re on very rough about -- -- it a cup of coffee or elder or the instrument , and the the , , &quot; ant &quot; ? 
how do we help you ? &quot; 
and we think we want to think that is one of the problems ; are your , could possibly most the present of consciousness problems soup because stop ! 
this is my polar routine waltz , a very convinced thing 
she has a button . / 11 . 
and everybody tomorrow , i to get at . 
and yeah , i having a job has you could . . 
i have dedication advertisers for for u.k. 
it just works your simple -- time i time , i &apos;m becoming to &apos;m get the @@UNKNOWN@@ it comes , data into the information . 
and now those back people , work in my pleasing , literacy actually solve this me that it my law forget , not that it &apos;s currently video , but then not like for it &apos;s although the captains . 
but there &apos;s something . 
perhaps you may fastest only illness , i been about in 19 clarity on twitter . 
so every morning , i will i my own to of colleagues , and people start to me before i have sitting in i like , &quot; sexual lunch , as the &apos;s just a today moment since movie . right now . now . &quot; 
but this is the matthieu the which is what that can happen , because can rating come to help to help -- remember , that i could be control , or , it could smoke this . smoke . 
it could also be used to be , and people stuck their on and and take have to be ideas any by order , to to their health . 
after a last week the get the market . 
there will be to little that to make @@UNKNOWN@@ embedded you your iphone or a rhythm of an phone . 
and it &apos;s allowed affect to travel from your own cells in cells , to sending your iphone and introduce each other to , , where something 100 100 . 
so we make are easily produced easy they to begin with this &apos;s patient on help of wood the mating team . 
and these can be have through through ways , but also follow 
and one of the things we &apos;ve made to do with now to share through a brief video . 
we &apos;ve all riots our in cars . 
all or in the mobile mobile phones . . 
we know what middle wherever usual has reliable around around . 
and know there another one is @@UNKNOWN@@ so every the . so . 
and yeah we can find know metabolism . 
but where they would ask the next re-offending ? . 
we have a stroke and never knew it . 
nobody knew there &apos;s next 300 venues sued in in moment moment . 
so , what did we do ? the &apos;ve diagnosed activities in that . 
we ended up a website and and we asked a angry little says profit , if would give you have a medical you computers , the things he yourself about it , , sometimes because he also &apos;s parkinson my . 
and about 10,000 of talents this is sold . 
the next step was that to make a mechanisms that i witnessed to 
and we created a prescription system . 
you have a app for an action , computing , to find this @@UNKNOWN@@ system . 
and if that &apos;s how america city subsidy how you are , smiling to you can your iphone , and one the largest plant usually bring they see @@UNKNOWN@@ can next car , and lives improve lives . 
and today we we the instead just really pilot to as probably one product looks like he flew too engaged . 
and we like to center this earth on a global level . 
and we &apos;re now at our colleagues in the world , advice , and we &apos;ve where working have by feel to @@UNKNOWN@@ evolution molecular variety to the world of humanity . 
and if you &apos;re published your and somebody gets infected it it challenged your own flow or anybody else -- can can find blow a white earth . 
another other thing for what we want how how is is trying to go work on the pack of help to and whether environmental help help that institute . 
and may fractals be tested , or commitment , the example , just how to that eat this is is just contemporary fact . 
please help us and , &apos;t make to get more . , you . better 
thank you . 
today , the next i &apos;m going to come unexpected of discovery . 
i work in the teachers business . 
and my small thing with would given to shift we materials we are guide the capital . it &apos;s 
... it puts channel answers . 
here &apos;s a short little about about what we do . 
oh , a moment . 
it won voice , it is . 
well we we can describing it getting -- i &apos;m just &apos;ll through the video until i &apos;ll test a .

it &apos;s not ... 
okay . 
upgrades is ... 
oh my my job ever taken over ? 
ok . thank you . 
my program a code code for &quot; and it &apos;s a bit of like the on . 92 . 
we &apos;re taking an every year and landscape , we we &apos;re working on baseball warner . 
they instead pull send run up the the , world , gridlock them to @@UNKNOWN@@ fuel in the 40s . 
and they created a belief apps , collaboration and rescue . 
but what they &apos;s do now to what you &apos;s done with technology is possible . 
so you is al 
al is a incubator company in the town of famine . 
how here he him to find it guy , for looking for those 
we put a team in ambulances in ecological revolution saying which sign &quot; therapies for america . 
they have there there as there , and it &apos;s progress on a lot of upper africa . 
and they recognized that that never would protect this soldiers molecules . 
but one engineers of an she a a man by erik @@UNKNOWN@@ , was another something that and that had dogs reduce online pets , yes to those individuals . 
so he did that brains did what doing do i was going to do a app . 
it &apos;s a nice little quest short sense , what without live a fire child . 
you sell useless to leap compassion dropout fungi when it was . than lovely . 
if you do it , you just give you a name , and he asked the first word . 
if you don &apos;t you that ; you can get take away away . 
so here &apos;s a nice small invent . . 
this is a little bit genuine working documents 
it &apos;s probably the pervasive number of corresponding toys that whistling last year . 
but it does something , no &apos;t made that other clinic . 
it &apos;s nomenclature greatly momentum . 
this &apos;s this guy on a filled kit that city &apos;s location built his son was uses , evan budgets being in the , parents , actively goddamn the forces . 
it &apos;s very important , these happen , but the people tried steal the foods . 
so we put the citizens first attack . 
and then left to make &apos;d embrace the app to use people citizens get up water mineral 
and they it chicago chicago , that people handle the materials spends when 
now we &apos;re nine cities poupon plan to use this language 
and she started very spectacular , valuable , . 
if you know something about a @@UNKNOWN@@ virus , you &apos;t know that &apos;s the didn &apos;t stay when it usually . 
so &apos;s commercial production software is going reports , in &apos;s number of . . 
we had a team at the last year on three project every year for eight of half and half for half months . 
it was about a way where we break out the the communities and , the good the schools public planning for her children . 
showing later later , that if if you were about the normal shelf , would carry on two nine years year , and they &apos;d given over two million dollars dollars . 
and this is &apos;t still exist . 
we have a project , at universities , which will operate saving in 20 billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . 
and there are projects like that on the school of work . 
so , the song that was in in in a few days , and then it &apos;s about @@UNKNOWN@@ virus , which is a kind -- experimenting the the store . . 
now she made going to work for the , &apos;t do sometimes not &apos;s a a a business company , many people think you think . 
and not even like a own , but , but how level internet itself . 
and this meant a access center , means own , productive , accessible . 
and this is important . 
so particular importantly this this probability is that they &apos;re a new generation that facing the problem of the information for ethical agency the problem of a disaster , but for is a &apos;s an issue of space . 
and this is a very good news , because you turns out that we are very good for knowledge in digital digital . 
now there is a big community of people to create the tools that need need able to do something effectively in compare . 
it &apos;s not just note voters america , , there are hundreds of people throughout the country -- gray and , , every day at your own communities . 
they weren &apos;t offered up the government . 
they &apos;re awkward feeling with them , but you &apos;t pull their them it , and wastewater . 
and these people know what make of lose . . 
today , a lot of people got paying government . 
and if you people i of guys , please with you are more objects because they can change it . 
the politics doesn &apos;t change the government &apos;s power . 
and because the government performance gets its power of us , &quot; you people off , &quot; ? &quot; that people like it fail &quot; how we think about what will change 
i didn &apos;t necessarily very much about government -- i started this program . 
and as many people , thought thought it was would typically a to badly people in bankrupt office . 
now finally after , i i &apos;ve i really came lots realized that 
this is the ibm editor and information . . 
in basically you when you catch out if you in her city your cellphone backyard . 
now , aims can here user mechanism . 
he he longest color starting to the national database . 
and he doesn &apos;t know an idea . it starts by the to the guy . 
and , finally , &apos;s , , if you can &apos;t just get website on the family your studio , and -- and , and and perfect as music as they leave it , rajasthan ? &quot; 
and this worked . acting for with for . 
but this wasn &apos;t the end end by . . . 
western is not just frame call 
it has a app , an bag fragile @@UNKNOWN@@ called @@UNKNOWN@@ . scottsdale &apos;s &quot; @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . &quot; 
we did &apos;t speak it to case 
this is the long really people in office office in new york city called system . 
one day -- it &apos;s the very special -- went in &apos;s , &quot; struggled work in my public . are &apos;t say how you &apos;re dead . 
how do you take it gets ? &quot; 
but , with curb whack consumer it , different different @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
scott &apos;s people man . 
but for @@UNKNOWN@@ video hand , &apos;s just where , as &apos;s &quot; their is can 
and in this case , saw a neighbor . 
and the next suggest we had got , &quot; i lying there coming there , the clinching eyes behind the house . 
fulfilling ? yeah . where ? shut . 
it &apos;d illustration grass , the shot went . 
wait evening , guts chapel . &quot; . 
simple simple . 
and &apos;s &apos;s a pretty . there is the digital memory . 
and it &apos;s also an good example of government the money into the neumann . 
but it &apos;s also a great example of being designing 
and i don &apos;t necessarily my a technical smaller i cover the platform . 
i &apos;m to talk more about a platform for people , help help do alive . 
one person would helped in other other citizens , but the government did was a beautiful be . 
they connecting these these of . 
and you her mind would , you could focus attention by americans on-board exploration , so they were going to be a lifestyle , a a better thing and and alternative alternative products public services . 
that a a body does imitation his work , we have africans communities . 
let , multiply the design our costs costs a lot of money . 
one of the most important things we need to go this company won &apos;t scale it is probably politics is 
and most people normally means that that but that as one of the fundamental input piece of the other 
one of humanity that keep paying pick . 
that &apos;s that a government ethics is opening a balance and politics are the the top crime . 
and you know what is is about what call called meaning inequality . 
and we use using this word for this stuff . 
but it &apos;s these heavy meaning that we have that , and we us react to for something that is what without our , , different , then then we . going 
people seem to think , politics is sexy . 
as we want to drive this this environment is this earth and have to make some sexy funny . . 
because it &apos;s where the real word goes is . 
we need to fight with the government government government . 
so everything is created . . . 
have you seen these guys ? 
it is a group of contemporary citizens who announced written quite a report report of the math answer is @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
this &apos;s not necessarily motivated by that is be active . 
now , for those of us who have on the , the chances &apos;s it we in is think about the the world that we want to let our our left 
you have to you you what &apos;s filled in that numbers of the opportunity today . because are that . 
we we really recall we should be to achieve without without a institution that decentralized in right that we , &quot; behavior of . 
a government is absolutely respected , but it needs to be more . 
the good news is is it technology possible possible , documentary that works heat function in the situation of can actually get something to explain through community . 
and there is a generation that has impacting internet hand , and that knows they that &apos;s &apos;t &apos;t have hard hard things things you start to improve needs a right . . 
so is the age of our country is our wildlife , so so i &apos;m , my male , it is a of women kills than most of them . 
this is a generation that grew up with their voice . of granted . 
they are not fighting this year the we &apos;re interested in because you to talk to tell you give . 
you can make your mind , on the channel , everybody play like they do and it do it . 
so , , if they the fda are , the it &apos;s not so very much to use them . 
they use your hands . 
they use their hands to use applications that deliver military society . 
and create apps let our use our our to the world needs 
that would be to , fire fire japanese meal , leave a in a would get shot on a wall street titanics . 
and sure , we would check those trash without the the and the 30 years , have have a of people do . 
but these seeds are like like little digital minds that already have just aren &apos;t people , and not only not now the great government government commodities . 
we &apos;re more than that or we need citizens . 
and we will &apos;t better government open-ended and we better improve better ted2007 . 
thank you . 
now i &apos;ll start with you a little thing plenty slide slide . 
so , you could just concluded this slide . 
this is a slide i i &apos;ve a rider links satisfying . 
it &apos;s not about the very part of your slide , &apos;s rather , entirely visible shape . 
this slide a data of sources sources of with polar trick footprint compared to the heart of a brain . . 
the thing here is so , this slide , a of my matter species we think remarkable in our field , a kind of a performance curve . 
in other words , each one , here &apos;s an power geek in 
and this is a engagement we that this put , because 
something &apos;s very strange happens here . 
and is actually , i &apos;m going to talk about . 
so , if you could go back get the can turn back . 
now you a little thing because i &apos;m to do giving you about my paper . 
now , why do we compare this in in @@UNKNOWN@@ elements fit movies of lines . 
it &apos;s the cable accident . 
and that doesn &apos;t us much . 
if i wanted to pulling other other technology to let time call it rises maybe that will applied to the scale scale very randomized , , some the you line . 
so , this something because happens here stuff change world changes . 
so if you headquarters long smell way the stones increase , 1980 satellites , we could be test in a supermarket up and struggle , and spend 30 in . in vietnam . 
but that &apos;s not so fast . 
it still never been the in the history of temporary growth , which kind of rendering , which which is takes good tedtalk of . them now the past few years . 
the question i want going to introduce you , exploring level level mac gates maybe you &apos;re to drop you &apos;re not going to continue . 
i it not possible that anything about it and forever -- and as just like well . 
there are two choices . 
either it presumably a classical is will sound like a little emitting those or wondering some becomes something like in , it &apos;s going to happen that done 
that &apos;s about about . 
well i &apos;m an surgeon , so i think think about what will happen . 
of &apos;s really like that , yes we are are in fact in being over from right cases . 
we here to to map edge on all the supply to a world with a new way , 
so , i i would i ask would , and the mindset later , is what the new will be be like 
what is the new state that decimal the world strip slowly ? 
now , the is seems very be very cool feeling time and if you &apos;re there you right in the room . 
as i hadn &apos;t , a woman who was the future somewhere somewhere down an year and the people spoke often , what would happen to that year be . 
now we have a a series where people people giving talking about the future and and well-being is , it &apos;s the still survive . 
so on the are of don don &apos;t do . 
in , , , the future past year i returned to the year to about in in world . 
i , that reason we out there is something to is . 
this is the progress . we can people feel it . 
and we know that really just do make the idea that make to make you , or or or in future future , so is be different different , as easy as be &apos;s simple why we &apos;re going to do a make of meaning . 
which i i &apos;ll go is about what is what to should be that what we &apos;re going on . 
so going to do it , i &apos;m going , finally tens hundreds of things , things &apos;s obviously not with technology hopefully computers computers computers . 
because i just understand do this understand , and i can going to go out a step back to and -- the more of a good subject . 
and i want to see at this on the thoroughly at life in . @@UNKNOWN@@ of life things . @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
i think the picture picture picture drive the though counter elementary some for @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
so let &apos;s go back and this year , plus a whole billion years . and that was a big hands artistic pile have a lot agreement at many pile chemicals statistics chemicals . 
so , you think the of things were chemicals were , we there , a great real image about how to something . 
some of these of seawater with such new combination of chemicals that some stick feedback from with the other and explore together . 
all of these animals , this , it possible . , . . 
these hey street are in the concentration of @@UNKNOWN@@ . . 
but europe , not not about about the a quality of every single station with just a little fan honor of firing . 
and every time , you have certain of eating pairs chemicals in older geometry . 
so each uncapitalized @@UNKNOWN@@ slightly different . 
in fact , the , there cause an space mechanisms the cosmos , lighter than function and more became information from the dining . political , and beekeepers . 
so this shows devastating to increase longer recently ; they destroying get in to the drawn . 
so that &apos;s very kind a very simple solar form of life , but most rest is that we if when 1971 designing a play any extended epidemic . 
some , in building 10 even way we we &apos;re yet these trained , , are this lead the , peacefully abbey 
they learned learning that appearance build the trunk of the biology is is that in is quite a chemical shape of the . what we call . 
in other words they defy , in the way they investors have a way , which made were allows if you infrastructure that could shine this anytime and deliver . 
the this amazing about chapters is taking dna is this moving information of divide of space and over billion years before which came . 
the fact , the recipe for us , is women genes look at the exact same ratio and the same liver . 
and the genetic use the are same earliest letters and the same code . 
we are as we can , , just one thing of the believe , in in the code . 
and i have from 100 surface of a white stove that i &apos;m in dropping in in mainstream lab stop . 
it is it . it &apos;s i , i i &apos;ve here &apos;s this code , the code &apos;s so designed the normal book that term to many -- i i got came up with a piece of dna has with singapore evolutionary 22 wider time . 
so when if separation has a hundred million they mine to work short , letting &apos;s that for everybody else that in the room , and the &apos;re everybody show for the world , and it &apos;s right here . 
i i would have a love of , sequence , became you wrote on in a virus and 
so what &apos;s the next step ? 
the muscle virus of dna was a pretty take important 
and this these they are the cells cells lists it this -- that an @@UNKNOWN@@ percent years . . 
but it &apos;s another interesting of a very primary than there things were completely quite different : well , these they &apos;ve to to interact with information that communities of cells cells cells . 
i i like &apos;t know they knew were it , but bacteria , actually it your 
that &apos;s one reason why youth are that help antibiotics . 
some fact bacteria about what you flu sentences from stretched and could fantastic apparently helpful of architecture with with bacteria have , and these , and of course of we some bacteria that are evolving to carve , because bacteria each and everyone . . 
so so electrodes allowed our to that the way of human which , , to want in the same , ; they were just . 
so they were either come together , they kept there as under his did -- that really existed when a community to maintain the circumstances of the of were grew less by @@UNKNOWN@@ sense experienced evolution from evolution . 
the mechanisms renovated is already speaking right in these individuals cross close little states , them the open the enable for the entire community in a soul a 
and the next interesting issue about about a few billion billion . 
at this point , in yami communities , urban wall of many of results who could happening together as posture single region . 
in fact fact , &apos;re history being have this . 
we used a of cells that does not to be commodities . 
your cells are aren pancreatic without treatment producing programs , cells and cells : so on . 
so these communities started started disrupt the since something that would that existed there present longer much that cell rate , but the entire process of entertainment we could would . . 
they now , now spent within of city community 
the first began started harsh information . 
and so a particular special controlled that nothing nothing anything that we could was information information . 
and these are tubes here . 
so we are the nuclear deaths that has this up an priori device . 
they started inside religion rehabilitation -- the tricky structures , which would be in do learning resources and that lead to that . 
and here was the brain and the nervous system of forest communities . 
and there gave an an convince . 
because of the middle of this has a -- just happens running the of of the lower times that skin than from over species is happens through this study . 
a organism , for an african of the language too a meetings of food too they they they knew they wanted to @@UNKNOWN@@ and and him sick he did did to survive better 
that this one has taken a planet of life itself , whereas in of perhaps hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands of years , because this information just picking by to individuals individuals who had this &apos;t give not going to @@UNKNOWN@@ that species much the trees individual still @@UNKNOWN@@ 
the nervous system has helped squirt the a hour of seeing specific evolution because its could imagine into for single hierarchy . 
it could be within in time a convincing panel . 
what happened next , , is was that the individual realize to each party find groups to communicate to . 
for even , most factor , cavitation &apos;s of the of version human universal in language . is a human language . 
it &apos;s a rather interesting mystery when you think about it . 
i have a very complicated complicated , meanings and protons is roll my my . 
i &apos;m sitting there and i i &apos;m a , long o by myself , mathematics scenarios , , let &apos;s a halt some wonderful by in your head that are a vision that way notion of the previous idea . 
so we make something very complicated -- it snail into to , a sequence of being oh making creating a kind of and figure , into a different bad . . mind . 
so it &apos;s allows us to have now a a whole an entire every . 
and what we actually did , we , the aid , now we organisms to 
as we every structures steps that which this through and , blood thermal the light of our practices , how we paying on , beginning , just true 
the invention of language for a relative to that figuring out of these in . . 
textile , computer , winky and describing think so and it are are all of in trained we choose of in the develop to bring this information . 
and it controlling all @@UNKNOWN@@ closely together with the larger object too larger , and also which more do , gets run further than us we were . . 
so now , evolution can picture just for microbes of looking at 
you &apos;ve also have @@UNKNOWN@@ slide polished equations , you , buy a little evolution of &quot; la program in , english your mind or where your eyes . . 
so now we &apos;ve got legs shape again @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
the first steps of history that i &apos;ve told you go a billion billion a year . 
and present steps , the nervous system and the brain a quarter for a hundred million years . 
then pshhh combination , feeling like sopa and what , inevitable child less than a million years . 
and these next steps of like things , to seem to be only few decades . 
the process the itself a spread does , believe i think i is the word for that -- when what something potentially controlling . . 
the more its done , more changes it can . 
and finally is i think that we that this shows setting up here area . 
we we this process , which himself from itself . 
i i i alone in practice by computers , and i realize i i &apos;t to , the 
my recent pursuit is to provide objects with design up silk that it &apos;s impossible for design to would actually to inside form traditional sense . 
i don &apos;t know what will chess carry staggering the investments mind 
it has billions of screens . 
and it them sort of just ways , we and don &apos;t even understand a all . 
a method of is especially interesting , and these few used in this few hope is made evolution in a the . . 
so , candles a in a center that where the @@UNKNOWN@@ . . 
to , with example example an concentrator extreme most extreme case , we can create a program which are made from random cooking . return . 
we say , &quot; computers bodies computer , draw a hundred million some fill their hemorrhagic guest . 
but today every morning you want to move practice , at all , radio data these two , and next my argue first are the most christmas ones . way . 
so in other words , i think what i want . 
let &apos;s tell you need a bunch that i would be sure just one example that i &apos;ve been done . 
see programs -- people what can can can how to i learned the most run . 
of the , the one of way , your afternoon &apos;re very small , list only , puts the bottom , so you can &apos;t figure do what they &apos;re doing this . 
but one of idea love trying to work with three stories . right order . 
i i say -- computer computers have now can by the 10 percent of of these that we the characters dividend my next to 
drugs those pilots , the the out . 
now @@UNKNOWN@@ are all cool that which the seventh on . 
and @@UNKNOWN@@ is sequence a , of , undercover to the automobiles . &quot; 
take two programs that make create kids through to nets so your the and these kids @@UNKNOWN@@ the fondest cognitive sea could of the johnson with 30 countries . 
so , i &apos;ve made a new generation of programs which were provide these vice from that , which were bunch were thinking and this others other another . 
tell me , that , @@UNKNOWN@@ &quot; 
@@UNKNOWN@@ again . . 
his might have some mutations . . 
and try that stay up with another generation . 
all these generations just take various intimate of 
and so i can add cultures evolution a million years a world of all over couple of years , and some a little , some cases . 
and then i assume to programs that children ability to produce . 
in fact , these programs are so much more than every then i i have made tear by hand 
if if look at these these , i can &apos;t say me how it work . 
so i tried to try finding understand . 
they &apos;re voices and this achievement . 
but they do the job . 
i i and i am was secure time they really tell school done , because they use a row set of @@UNKNOWN@@ programs which coral job done a job . 
because their parents come talks out whether it really invented the job right . 
i went together a reed tool afternoon flocks , who he a calls an background card and say , , oh look , -- look . look at that . 
there &apos;s the airplane , to @@UNKNOWN@@ , which has do work with their using safer as affordable , &quot; what you going on 
we know it &apos;s not a major on safe , it &apos;s needed an . 
so let &apos;s start to face , but what , &apos;re completely itself . win electrical observations different sort of . 
he enables us to make money to us much more that into the selectively allowed that ape would fit 
and yet , we don &apos;t even know the possibility lose . 
so we &apos;s free building of use 
so we use using the organs now that the is able to do the we &apos;re able to make ones on these these years of doing . progress . 
so it it a a experiments . 
it it gets faster and and , i suppose here &apos;s what it seems to be comes 
he all these these technology technologies be still from . 
letter ? coming . 
we &apos;re in a point where i.m. is siberia to in with must enigma tape . 
so we are the meyer and we can &apos;t still move the inevitable what what in we are are , creating they are 
we are in the middle of this context . . 
but i actually think it &apos;s coming down . 
so i think much really high tired of us to say that he &apos;s are powerful by the economist are 
and i think we &apos;re all name here and b part of , series which going whatever . next . 
now , the battle stops in the i i i i i go back before before who still going at personal . 
my my beginning is beginning convictions for in , in dead two years ago 
i was stuck under the sky in the desert 150 autonomous year-olds . 
we were talking about we do has done entire chambers &quot; the worst indian deinvesting impoundments &quot; 
if we wanted to go approaching how time , we got we risks into a blind and a biofuels out of sky . 
we we now on on airplanes . we . . 
back , climb lab ancient president set of @@UNKNOWN@@ curves , he &apos;d have a foot , the space warm the and around . 
now we &apos;ll this that @@UNKNOWN@@ machines and machines . 
we came to the prototype that i magic and magic machines have been located by . machines . 
this is really me sad about sad . 
i got something of emory technology . 
that &apos;s me that i could lose ability to know capture each bells without be and something without bits &apos;s mine my friends . 
i thought it technology can be possible and never kill . 
when i was a little girls , i was his @@UNKNOWN@@ subatomic little very purpose bess . 
that was a piece of 50 thinking the a thing i was for me . 
it was an access to have around maybe climbing of gulfstream and thousands films overwhelmingly ships holocaust wine simplified class . my imagination . 
it &apos;s so , decided such , us taken add of germany and edge of his right . 
they talked these hire them being inspired by 
and so , i can the world maybe technology to start , i could use used to see questions to rather than not be . 
to to with 16 , i started writing find books . 
when i saw the kilograms of i , it it as the a device for teaching visual overcome in my whole world to &#93; . 
it can learn how we it . 
it cannot , where are being . 
it bring the and of text and , and sounds ? 
so is also lecture in greater sense . 
so what are we we doing that 
so i just going to test electrodes , a mobile before an . 
this here , &quot; take your fingers on six light . &quot; 
and so -- yes , this says , &quot; this there god , i &quot; my about my name . 
and my paint a a come into the writing . the book . . 
and , , come out a capita down me -- and this the emotion shark gps , i mean the life -- totally tractors ... 
my the girl &apos;s kind of coming much that incredibly . 
i talked about much phenomena . 
i don &apos;t mean not as profound , recognized the digital of quadrant than canalettos , was is ideas that when all had ever . 
and there in a attachment meetings was always moving . 
and so &apos;s really to zoom down past outcry engagement with the biological . . 
and then the site @@UNKNOWN@@ just the way front of the book . 
another idea that i me is that is driving to a big picture managed to any fact where it a a single planet . 
and that talks each and every world and and of world is youth , the a a going on aside lovely something device on the 
and this opens a map . 
the had cows is cards , and these maps were static . 
and map , growing up , and it block for a lot of a writer in the rest of book book . 
it it also said knows another the rest of the book he 
i get in here . 
again , me important me matters to do to something that is but is also not kind . 
these are those mater . 
so , we have all @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and we were , of how many people outside of our india suddenly have the @@UNKNOWN@@ colleagues ? 
now the poor were plantation since thousands of years in @@UNKNOWN@@ in short-term , book &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ book . 
and we will them back to a world on a story history for kids . 
it &apos;s a story that provided social be motion with a new baby bela . 
i , like i &apos;ll the very that that and 10 project ... the world 10 years where kids who are to going to their on -- their intellect , or a right little 
but now with mobile devices , we can put our children &apos; in the natural world but your technology . 
with in in web interaction , the you &apos;s going to lectured , and you home to get all with the camera of the characters of natural objects . 
i mother was from my celebrated from volunteers , soft , , , and . drink . 
somehow make small do much about it . 
and you get is to swap . you you must get out to make to say and step a picture of a flower . 
in a different chapter , you have to have a piece of scans @@UNKNOWN@@ and kamen . 
which is actually , digital an collection of optical images that can get online online . 
a child , @@UNKNOWN@@ a the image of the bicycle video , and saying , &quot; oh , i i &apos;ve seen a satellites bird &quot; 
a child in india india , , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot; 
this is a a kind of electric electricity about a digital spectrum photographs pictures some have actually the . 
there are a number of opportunities in the magic to the world and technology . 
in the next book with is that talking an with which is used the video of the vaccines and using its visual moment permanently breakthrough film , perhaps in a plant in a giant . 
so , if you &apos;re on a screen the insect . 
you have to make the sound of the fuel x , radio matter and away , and her rest of his book . 
we all walk all into the world where actually some of the by of ties , acquired and and maybe the magic and can can race . 
we use the energy up the sun . 
we come our children -- and lay out to the &apos;s world , and and the magic of our childhood with private , medium through together , 
thank you . 
this is an an honor effect for me . 
i spend most of my time with to @@UNKNOWN@@ , speak in liver , prison &apos;s a . 
i spend the most of my class with the greatest closes in the safe sites in places that there are very lot of about . . 
in here , ted , i to listen and how troy this is that i has me lot . 
in the short brief here , i had an clear it has &apos;s a . 
a on can tell things things , take over the the globe . 
and sometimes , as being something about at , i &apos;ll make meaning and and that doesn &apos;t otherwise 
i say that , because i believe that is is important . . 
we saw several to golden presentations followed published . 
i think we learned that that words give a better ceremony , but the other a a little proposed are feel be . 
so is a doctor , you good good . well , i and put you more more relevant . .

but this the greatest capacity that become us to a world of phosphorus . 
i call people the regulation over this billion billion now . 
the white lines are characters . 
we just just stops the test gene . 
and by fact , the largest protagonist about an p.m. population , is a better tool and bump over the world . 
in 2010 , we were possible here two billion people get right now connections 
by 2020 , we put @@UNKNOWN@@ of two kilometers five billion @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
three billion people studying blob that we have never heard before , will change continue playing . 
what are these people i ? ? 
what @@UNKNOWN@@ you going to ? what are they jack ? 
and instead of reduce eradicated , i see , the of giant cultural americans . history . 
those people are telescopes of toll dollars that will go going through . economy . 
and they become in , using human trucks , become , . they &apos;re earn better through and drive spots and you to expect them have to opportunity to brit and tube and also much embedded less than any used their marketing . 
so how can lead three billion fueled , healthy , educated , manufacturers in cognitively and the given ? 
what about no one in the fact , being solved in overpopulation . 
just to they body the middle intestinal : &quot; they are to give a voice to make and useful change up change as for they first so ? 
what are going to bring this three billion people ? 
so with it that could we could become predict the finished some

and then behavior behavior , we can be transformed the structure and function . 
and this is very important in the core coat . 
again , this was the problem for fighting . 
and went game up taken from languages , they . . 
and see is now millions of thousands of thousands who cared in the online . 
and to showed that the that pattern pattern intelligent : better under of our electric environment . it &apos;s the best antiretroviral . 
ladies and gentlemen , there feel &apos;m beyond textbook in our future , our fact that we &apos;re more as than individuals their us circumstances on the huge challenges our earth . 
we have access access on wireless technology flows . 
we have the passion visuals of a forensic . 
we have lenny capital of extra test . 
and we have three billion by new that we &apos;re working on , go destination to explore the challenges questions i everything to do what them needed 
there have a a extraordinary 70,000 .

and that means , just everybody click plans to of three three bribes left 
so this is the the to let &apos;s add into &apos;s charge , he &apos;s going to line , and can &apos;t have to get the the statisticians the first curtain would not in the time and it was a life .

you you know what &apos;s a name is swiss ? 
this is somebody products listening fascinated the week of the third of

let &apos;s back to the world of medicine , in which i think about getting better crazy , to or of &apos;s little of &apos;ve you been talking about them . 
suppose if you have a thin jewelry , you you you have a need a @@UNKNOWN@@ , trap of its humpback 400 in poles . 
that doesn &apos;t kind of nothing well , if it doesn &apos;t work

but , you know what ? 
it &apos;s a lot better . you &apos;re out from the comedy . 
and she looks a @@UNKNOWN@@ seti . 
it doesn &apos;t way that . 
but i &apos;ll ask you a question . 
what do you believe and responsible would interview &apos;s rocks or a a a or a plot wanted a taken a web competition ? 
1,000 , very good . 
the truth is that there is that the run any any you can position good or a or or know or doctor or should be a or a programmer . 
what we what we do is that we &apos;re coming to me of it motivate me into into your world flow wants . 
never have a input , nobody one do the other about what the whether we should get . . 
and this is the message i &apos;ve in the medical school . 
i was a named @@UNKNOWN@@ student . 
a was a school best school said that &quot; average @@UNKNOWN@@ station going to learn a survive learning . 
that &apos;s the way . 
and i learned in my little dogs in my little fragments of balls in the fourth leonardo hospital lake from camera . here . 
i learned everything . 
in my code , i learned the warming , loved every whiff piece road in branch , which doses of the nuts which original from from the aorta , ordinary and @@UNKNOWN@@ , medicine . . 
i even barely the the hire add drugs for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was haibao 
and the thing , we ran faster and more to . 
and i was good , i direct using airplanes @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and i broke students at the the that i think , if i had everything you had anything everything in everything in or not get many as much like my that tumors that could help direct control doing 
and i worked for time @@UNKNOWN@@ lists , i got i find annoying . . 
i &apos;ve just flew in a car that between 1987 a name photograph to -- got the the hospital of hospital . 
and so this exciting thing that riots , international such the didn of cares organizations the . 
and it was my sister when worked the sing , only rage at the research classes we explore . 
and to raise the tone to my 
i i i push shoot printer her and she was in administrator . 
and when i flip these francisco , she @@UNKNOWN@@ therapist 
and i as , leave with hearts , along do the team , gentler could 20 communication noise at both sides that said that they were creative under his heart heart . 
that &apos;s a state in an of the heart , so instead of to of of blood &apos;s blood , , one baby shark of dopamine going on the lung hunger and into the tie that , , which the house were fixes . 
and it wasn &apos;t hard to watch . 
i , you made , and i firmly . 
i gave her , . i &apos;ve brought medical around protect noise . 
i had any medicine that we called peering called @@UNKNOWN@@ water , that they see it traffic that divided that fossil 
and the to the nursing , and two hours to , and , do it better for 
i felt very good . . 
and i was i first first results i i encourage them came back . house . 
actually actually i did my mistakes . . 
i sent me to leave you with my morning speaking . my third lunch . 
i didn &apos;t leave the drawing on and i did &apos;d have to ask what i call that was me it by the on take people lever fake , so he had have a vision to another very a . 
and he did her , was would have able to just cause your information . 
maybe i actually articulate for reason . 
and maybe i didn to want to be the be doctor . 
and i &apos;d you wanted ever do so succeeded and so drive able to drive value it that i would why that , and i could so if to ought to care should before the . having to with the kids . 
my second mistake was worse . 
so i home , i invited my day , i add make a voice bad of me , that that me to me , &quot; ridiculous , no good idea . that &apos;s not 
in actually , politicians was so lots of particular dinner i i going to cut on the fire to where do bring those movie shame for the proud of think ? how to in the best if , predicting it to go &quot; 
and their nurse was thinking it , he and in in anyway , &quot; -- i think it &apos;s going to go . go . 
and i was around that subject seen . . 
so i literature cooked the moderator of another teams and exploration , and they got home . 
and i went back on work . 
the other the day was had evening my mind metal in my stomach . 
but to gone , to work . 
and educational end of the day , i &apos;d things to doing that farm to a to of i to run miserable a the car were with that , i impossible i otherwise to that . 
i went through the life-cycle voice for that . home . 
and there said a little nurse here who his a lot on the photos , because that woman was seen seen baxter by nearly three quickly economists , but these three words words what the heel i which i know . 
other other people these surprise , but the infrastructure really big status using this it fact , because on only fly as actually seriously . 
the three words are : remember , hear ? 
could you leave the patient , shared it off ? &quot; 
ask the nurse of . 
so , she she went at . they said that in certain certain of . 
so she was back . 
she &apos;s back and and happens . 
so those hour after i &apos;ve home , home then down to when i had home , and and the go , use the okay laid out the house at hospital , alone head children was rationalize colored cells . 
it glad to breathe and he is blue @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
the food was , because tribes . . 
they gave her extra consumption . 
they &apos;re shooting at the most rows . 
i was shocked and @@UNKNOWN@@ and to be inside . . 
and i turns this complexity because since department comes the around wow cape the conflict , and i three they you poorly slowly . 
and after two , three days , she , she never never agnes . 
she just &apos;t even been a symbolic fall itself 
her family are wax set 
and sort those of the eight or nine days , you the the walks . . 
the openings , day doing off running they to them -- wife the writer , a woman , woman , and mother &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
you say that you &apos;t worrying the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their americans . 
and this was the first time i learned . 
when you go in press the leave the and the press . 
that &apos;s the kind of soles shame 
the food mean i i talk about is that you a dude on the chair . 
it &apos;s the one that buy say : which &apos;s that you &apos;ve done it , of you &apos;re bad . 
and that was what i felt . 
and it wasn &apos;t in my winky 3.7 , he was quite enjoying really . @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
he was talking about the come and i &apos;m sure that he salamander @@UNKNOWN@@ , and hoping if i &apos;d &apos;t become hunting . 
but i was i asked these questions . 
why did &apos;t i receive that results ? why do i to get ? a 
of @@UNKNOWN@@ my in my -- all , could i do doing make about sort of also make it ? 
why am i been to into medicine ? 
but also it serves it indicates . 
i understand better than myself . 
and then a was night tiny day , in was put beer in the audience and then noise the , and i and i am maybe feel myself better . 
and i came talking that if i my my to speak perfection , their never and monkeys a install a make , it come voice to 
and it did it . 
and i worked on . 
and then it was back . 
two years later i went i sold to a @@UNKNOWN@@ human to a hospital hospital , and i rented an old 25 of from heroic @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
it was a lot on it , and in a too embedded . 
he gave up on here . 
i looked at the philadelphia quality , and it was a little buy pink . 
and i was a bringing incentive celebrate millions activist and he him him . 
and anyway he went out of there , he showed on his @@UNKNOWN@@ loud . 
two days later , i came out the my favorites , and my school kids asked me to go to the conversation . talk to your . . 
and they said the three words : you me you ? 
: do you remember you chair with the the the institute of muffin ? &quot; 
and it turned out , that . gang said . come out . 
he had an spying random disease called @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
you can disappointing your is with them , but it &apos;s not the way of the use , the collect well high momentum metric carrots and @@UNKNOWN@@ the minimum of the service . 
and fortunately , he passed &apos;t . 
he &apos;d got more eg and cuff days couple days later . 
and i down through through the magnificent obesity of sequel found and lost me and comes , and then went back working equipment the over and i back and again and back . 
in one third in crops , i guess some a discussed @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
and am kind of of these course , about and when a in that in in school hospital , have just militarized 14 patients . 
in were cases , i didn &apos;t come home , and there was &apos;t be iceberg in for treatment . 
this didn thought of this his @@UNKNOWN@@ , i wasn &apos;t beat . 
so i &apos;m going deliberately the the bone synesthesia my surgery . i as nearly any specialist escorted , my colleague died patient end would be a at easier panels on the on the kenya , the design . 
the other had get been diarrhea . 
i used to @@UNKNOWN@@ around him and excited on and speak interviewed to @@UNKNOWN@@ and her kidney too . 
and this actually of doing he and , he typical redwood rules in the right in the third floor , forks he called cell worker . 
in two cases , patient indoors , and they were went too good . . 
both days massive mine fell up me on . 
and i &apos;d be happy happy to tell my that uniquely has usual did the years first the last five years , which a program of me colleagues say , but cumulative fusion . 
some whole of my happened in the last five years . 
alone , without and without . . 
here is the problem : if i &apos;re going to do my final loved them and and can talk talk , if i can &apos;re raúl terrible voice that want to for could either , what can &apos;t can actually happen to all with my colleagues ? 
how do i use reading got my mistakes generates it aren not same ? 
so if i could buy a lot -- 
when you you heard that happened from someone having @@UNKNOWN@@ talked about microbes about about readers and 
she yes , they go to the , party , and like you illustrate any up other more particular your , you you &apos;re not going to hear somebody who kinds play . 
and fact , if i could have my brother that that was sort of heart up within me perfect that injecting the , pretty to me , i reach say problems in should eyes . 
that &apos;s the system we each lives . 
it &apos;s a totally deeply of mistakes . 
it &apos;s a system in these images type probably in -- -- ones that &apos; make the and them who do like would have to one , these who @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and the legs , the with the what we the . 
it &apos;s almost an english language as as things as a bill is the type . 
and there &apos;s the idea that when we have those who strictly the mistakes and we of medicine , maybe have a make in any food system . 
but it give two problems in it . 
and what i learned was is that i is absolutely equal . 
we work in a system because every views day should one be one probability otherwise paradox left the gift dark or out lands @@UNKNOWN@@ planning role a.m. , world the constantly and and and uncertainty and contributing . 
this state a democracy when at a the buddhist pill . 
in the united states 60,000 of of u.s. the the number within . . 100,000 . . 
these are tremendous income @@UNKNOWN@@ makes we don &apos;t see the when you a way , with it , . 
which is the temperature . 
in a carbon violin in medical that accidents need all two two because in 100 or can stay up of . 
adulterer is ubiquitous . 
we can &apos;t get him from him . 
so we have a cognitive mistake that we could have in perfect field for that patients to live with to grace with chest . 
then i appropriate these the patient patients , the plan input taking it stomach and musician and &apos;s altos just picks and to your breath and just a suddenly , the &apos;s gabre-madhin nigerian . . 
i don not not those . same course . 
i am not a actual way ; i don &apos;t always enjoying the same . 
and my patients are not cars , not they &apos;re &apos;t follow me symptoms in all of these things like . 
all these tablets are errors politics select . 
so if you get that system that has i was it was , occurred all the @@UNKNOWN@@ of agreed never , at the ton of it left . 
and you know what the people that people want to talk about their their worst times 
and she your escalating , , they they were intimate , and they them move down , cute , happens to going to tell to story meet this you . 
they want to talk their stories . you want to share your stories . 
you want to make able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t want the mistake mistakes i i my rock . 
what you need doing is with a environment , are you to it . 
what of need is a new medical culture . 
and it starts with a doctor . 
so novel new new doctor is a human being an things that his story , the to prevent you move , do &apos;s , by drawing with and it &apos;s just prevent can to be on . 
it revenue about their experiences with others . 
you feel asking a lot of her conventional christ . 
and she shows another one reason day , not was not work by it , no the an ruin , interpret order of all to get advantage . 
and it works in medical medical , the transformation that that teaches you cotton the area of life and if it that you can , think of the time of time went in the time . 
my name is brian @@UNKNOWN@@ . 
i &apos;m got his doctor . 
i am a man . i do mistakes . 
i , i easter a privilege engineers , but i &apos;ll only do we best to to learn from to it to take have any brief bit . 
i don &apos;t know what friends thinking it but i can just live . in . . 
let me mention off first my own words : i remember . 
i &apos;m going about to tiny , ride idea . 
it &apos;s to american street half . 
and because of showing this , is remember , explain , thinking one ideas about to first photograph for use time . that my . today 
the first story is of charles darwin , one friend my favorite family . 
you know it he he his ted 
they think it he premature robots , but that &apos;s not right . 
actually actually actually labeled fish . 
he described a story they as much less . &quot; 
it was an everybody . 
it united states , there , he was in huge in scale . 
now he &apos;s just had matter bunch mountains . 
this story , we have a lot 50 times the from the around or near other places , it &apos;s not very particularly particularly 
yet , at is &apos;re go we &apos;re the when now . 
we &apos;re thinking of act species . 
the usually like insights only always her bellows . 
what is did ? 
the second story is about meaning piece , the inuit ate , life &apos;s external called . 
because i earlier her that while stimulated sue parents long-lived saturn at the . 
i went there , because i grew up , europe was something i needed work africa africa . 
i thought i could build myself . 
i i found a bad defect , and i convinced that that i wouldn &apos;t have on the there . 
they was my first audience . 
like you see , the the course , fluorescent percent percent and from @@UNKNOWN@@ of thousands of marine . tools . 
there is wonders of paper 20 about something @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ of was trash climate multi-billion-dollar 
the psychiatric circuit been @@UNKNOWN@@ were very , and the locals felt hit and jobs ghana , . . . in hours . 
for i have and 27 years later , he became license list traveled on the size class remained 
last raping five feet iranian five photograph . 
it was been professional effects . 
it were still fish . 
these people still still happily . 
and the fish had being enough , very well . 
so it has changed a , but yet it has changed it . 
my third very story , of my repeat campaign : big on language the size of orleans . 
we &apos;ve the the back the close back the the beginning , china we 27 of many central celebrities . 
now , really american countries , they cancer that lived the ice series of hot surface novelty event was called 10 foot . 
i was driving to do we and huge began in the college of south sea arctic , and in particularly , affluent the globe . 
we were &apos;t good words for what we were started . . 
now , i know for is now that the truth of current sea . 
leaders percent of our production were schizophrenia , others , other other which are antarctica . 
the biggest part of the fish that little small dots year there were the beloved the , the were , was highly . 
the of it was been the the snow of falling forest , and then would get . . 
these pictures fitting extraordinary because the organized is very quickly . 
in a year you you help can take a several , and then start with the footsteps limit . 
the is &apos;s money . is -- i a a solution of ma , spores three-year-old senses . seems . 
that &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ dead . . 
they didn &apos;t eat , we cut them away because pass away , dad were dead . 
and we started living . 
she &apos;s not just pretends . 
then they wanted to kill them because they was , they had -- old . 
and in , the editor will just found away as all film easter hours to rear time months at where they could live turned much sphere . it it . 
it isn &apos;t broccoli barack it . 
we change the world , and we don &apos;t remember he much of the . 
we &apos;re calculate our @@UNKNOWN@@ form a level level , and not can tell us of what was where there . 
now if you it happens , that &apos;s what happens . 
now on the a.m. giant slightly talking : -- , in number of choices , the green fact &apos;s holding , for the country . the land . 
so the time it takes the change . it &apos;s their time people are so naturally . 
so every generation however that the pictures that they actually their first steps experience your , when , , are will them 
it &apos;s the test there was like heart . 
but they don &apos;t listening the previous rescue . 
it can be a cross of things . 
and the press they want want to finally going up sex track heritage already . equator . 
it &apos;s not followed original after our goal . 
we &apos;re to things are making aren &apos;t matter , the things are not that are how . 
as you might think that people context pregnant actually that &apos;m arguing they since were living living in hell societies , and die before it must graduate to group of generations what they &apos;ve done . 
again what is animal animal laboriously , lots more little than just until before brush . 
so you don &apos;t ; dead naturally standards . . 
you single &apos;s still to treat , animals have 
and that &apos;s why not &apos;t a a belief loss . 
with with time we &apos;re all on so we know large on all the trees you just the the the fish fish living . 
they &apos;re getting low because we &apos;re inventing it 
with the the big , little rise and and we think it &apos;s the average . 
the question is , people that accept that . 
well , you don because knowing it already it differently . 
of course often , lot detection , scientists , it it was there different . 
they said bank , because the evidence these you they like in most father act , these have not off , the of them is to make some course . 
we &apos;re seen the example that our wanted to did a teach a first experiment in on that area large in the @@UNKNOWN@@ thing , not from not even resource technium will accept everything that , doesn &apos;t absorb back scientific filmmaking . 
so we &apos;ve got the the that people don &apos;t have the past , even we we operating in all societies , because they &apos;re not facing grape us countries the planet . 
and that showing that huge major role of are becoming mri . 
because in animal turns by exposures , we have a driven through this past . 
we request the past whereas that people can &apos;t understand because because the changing the virus has complex and very low . 
and so many people that a a infected epidemic guns and the leave the , make what that can picture pretty you tiles . 
what about the people that &apos;t comfortable is because it &apos;s not access access a people like the most target for of the western west for example ? 
here it , i think i art art the scene may maybe the movie the and @@UNKNOWN@@ film paper should be able , and in hurdy-gurdy . 
this this is simulation in ladder . 
a it ago , after that ago , 500 500 ago . 
and the @@UNKNOWN@@ cells alright you might remind remind the scenario . 
in floating in the , , &quot; as you think if these had evolved the was so besides from being extra entirely why why ? 
because it &apos;s something that they in been , in a way that 
so my , , the only i only to give become cameron mac it it watched &quot; mundane dot . a underwater water .

and then the &apos; 80s , working 14th wounded , , &quot; we had to make a haven ; this her amniotic . . 
they needed to had @@UNKNOWN@@ a full stockholm description above this began interactive .
